        "text":["We solved this by writing a bunch of code to make the server print the state of the client structs, and really just brute-force attacking the server with different attack strings we conceived. The goal was simply to initially knock-out the InUse flag, since the rest of the code suggested that having an anonymous client writing to another client's buffer was the ultimate solution. So we just needed to figure out how to get the program into such a state.\n\n\nOur brute-force string attack wasn't very systematic, but in fact it only took a few minutes before we noticed that one of our attack strings had successfully knocked out the InUse flag. From there, all we had to do was to understand the rest of the code paths by which we could use this anonymous client to overwrite another client's buffer with \"pwd.txt\", prior to the server opening that client's welcome file. So in sum, knowing these strategies, we just needed to figure out the specifics. Ultimately, we solved it by the following high-level sequence:\n\n\n1) Client B connects to Server, and sends a 1025-byte string, of which only the 1025th byte is the null-character.\n\n  Result: This knocks out the InUse flag, creating the \"anonymous\" client \"A\".\n\n\n2) The server client structs now have all InUse flags set to zero. Thus, the next client to connect will be assigned the same struct to which anonymous client \"A\" can still overwrite. So for this step, Client B connects to the server but does NOT immediately send the handshake.\n\n\n3) While the server waits for the handshake from Client A, anonymous Client B writes \"pwd.txt\" to the client buffer shared by \"A\" and \"B\".  However, in this case, the \"message size\" parameter (the first two bytes sent) some very large number, which causes the server to block in the recv() call before clearing the buffer again.  This occurs after the server writes \"welcome.txt\" to the Client A buffer, but before the server calls open(buffer). This is the intercept that is core to the server attack.\n\n\n4) Client B sends the handshake, causing the server to call open(\"pwd.txt\"), and sending the output back to Client B.\n\n\n5) Clients A and B then go to the Moscow corner store for vodka and cigarettes.\n\n\n\nIn code, the vulnerability (although there may be others) is the memset() call at line ___ in EchoServer.cpp. When this is called, the EchoServer calls sizeof(buffer) to zero out the buffer; however, if the client has sent a string that is size 1025 with buf[1024] = '\\0', then the memset call overwrites the InUse flag. This is because the least-significant bit of the InUse flags is located directly after the 1024th byte of the buffer, per ____-endian format. Thus, if the client sends a string of size __ 1025 __, then the InUse flag gets knocked out, and the Client becomes a sort of anonymous client that can write to the client buffer more or less whenever they want, through the server's echo interface. From there, other aspects of the code allow the attack to occur, but the InUse flag is the real vulnerability which allows these other aspects to be exploited.\n\n\n\n\n",

See \n\nFigure 2.1. From the front of the relay, insert four rack screws (two on each \nside) through the holes on the relay mounting flanges.\nReverse the relay mounting flanges to cause the relay to project an additional \n2.75 inches (70 mm) from the front of your mounting rack and provide \nadditional space at the rear of the relay for applications where the relay might \notherwise be too deep to fit.\n\nPanel Mount The SEL-311C panel-mount option provides a clean look. Panel-mount relays \nhave sculpted front-panel molding that covers all installation holes. Cut your \npanel and drill mounting holes according to the dimensions in Figure 2.1. \nInsert the relay into the cutout, aligning four relay mounting studs on the rear \nof the relay front panel with the drilled holes in your panel, and use nuts to \nsecure the relay to the panel.\n\nThe projection panel-mount option covers all installation holes and maintains \nthe sculpted look of the panel-mount option; the relay projects an additional \n2.75 inches (70 mm) from the front of your panel.

Contact \nSEL for optional screw types.\n\nRing terminals are recommended. Maximum tongue width is 7.9 mm \n(0.31 inches).\n\nChassis Ground Ground the relay chassis at terminal Z27 using a minimum #14 AWG copper \nconductor.\n\nPower Supply Connect control voltage to POWER terminals. Note the polarity indicators on \nterminals Z25(+) and Z26(–). Control power passes through these terminals to a \nfuse and to the switching power supply. The control power circuitry is isolated \nfrom the relay chassis ground.\n\nFor UL/CSA compliant installations, a 15 A circuit breaker with \ndisconnecting means must be installed in the power supply line to facilitate \nservicing the unit.\n\nRefer to Section 1: Introduction and Specifications for power supply ratings. \nThe relay power supply rating is listed on the serial number sticker on the \nrelay rear panel.\n\nOutput Contacts All relays come with polarity-dependent high-current interrupting output \ncontacts for OUT101, OUT102, and OUT103 and with standard contacts for \nOUT104–ALARM.\n\nSee High-Current Interrupting Output Contacts on page 2.10.\n\nExtra I/O OUT201–OUT212 can be ordered with standard or high-current interrupting \noutput contacts. An optional extra I/O board with eight high-speed, \nhigh-current interrupting contacts is also available, as is an extra I/O board \nwith four standard output contacts.\n\nRefer to Specifications on page 1.2 for output contact ratings. Refer to the part \nnumber on the serial number sticker on the relay rear panel to determine the \nnumber and type of output contacts on the extra I/O board of your relay.\n\nStandard Output Contacts\nModel 0311 part numbers with a numeral “2” in the field in bold below \n(sample part number) indicate 12 standard output contacts on the extra I/O \nboard (OUT201–OUT212):\n\n0311C21HA3A5421\n\nStandard output contacts are not polarity dependent.\n\n! WARNING\nOUT101, OUT102, and OUT103 are not \npolarity-dependent in legacy SEL-311C \nrelays. See Table 1.1 for features that \ndistinguish a legacy SEL-311C from a \nnew SEL-311C. If you replace an older \nSEL-311C with a newer style SEL-311C, \nensure that the connection polarity \nfor OUT101, OUT102, and OUT103 is correct, \nand ensure that OUT101, OUT102, and \nOUT103 are not connected to ac loads.\n\n\n\n2.10\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nInstallation\nMaking Rear-Panel Connections\n\nModel 0311 part numbers with a numeral “4” in the field in bold below \n(sample part number) indicate four standard output contacts on the extra I/O \nboard (OUT201–OUT204):\n\n0311C21HA3A5441\n\nHigh-Current Interrupting Output Contacts\nAll relay models have high-current interrupting output contacts for OUT101, \nOUT102, and OUT103. Model 0311 part numbers with a numeral “6” in the field \nin bold below (sample part number) indicate 12 high-current interrupting \noutput contacts on the extra I/O board (OUT201–OUT212):\n\n0311C21HA3A5461\n\nHigh-current interrupting output contacts are polarity dependent. Note the + \npolarity markings above terminals A01, A03, A05, B02, B04, B06, . . ., B24 in \nFigure 2.4. The extra I/O board of the relay in Figure 2.3 does not show these \n+ polarity markings (because it is the rear panel for an extra I/O board with \nstandard output contacts).\nAs an example, consider the connection of terminals B01 and B02 (high-current \ninterrupting output contact OUT201) in a circuit. Terminal B02 (+) must have a \nhigher voltage potential than terminal B01 in the circuit. The same holds true \nfor output contacts OUT202–OUT212. For OUT101, OUT102, and OUT103, terminals \nA01, A03, and A05 must have the higher potential.\n\nFast Hybrid High-Current Interrupting Output Contacts\nModel 0311 part numbers with a numeral “5” in the field in bold below \nindicate eight fast hybrid high-current interrupting output contacts on the extra \nI/O board (OUT201–OUT208):\n\n0311C21HA3A5451\n\nFast hybrid high-current interrupting output contacts are not polarity dependent and \nmay be used to switch either ac or dc loads. Short transient inrush current may flow \nwhen a switch that is in series with the contact is closed while the contact is open. \nThis transient will not energize the circuit used in typical applications. Trip and close \ncoils and standard auxiliary relays will not pick up; however, an extremely sensitive \ndigital input or light duty, high-speed auxiliary relay may pick up for this condition. \nThe transient occurs when the capacitance of the output contact circuitry charges. A \nthird terminal (B03 in Figure 2.6) provides a path for charging the capacitance when \nthe circuit is open.\n\nFigure 2.8 shows some possible connections for this third terminal that will \neliminate the possibility of transients when closing a switch. Circuit load is \nnot shown. In general, the third terminal must be connected to the dc rail that \nis on the same side as the open switch condition. If an open switch may exist \non either side of the output contact, only one condition may be considered. \nTwo open switches (one on each side of the contact) defeat the charge circuit.\n\nNOTE: Do not use the high-current \ninterrupting output contacts to switch \nac control signals.\n\n\n\n2.11\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nInstallation\nMaking Rear-Panel Connections\n\nFigure 2.8 Possible Connections for Fast High-Current Interrupting Output Contacts \n(Third Terminal Connection Is Optional)\n\nOptoisolated Inputs The optoisolated inputs in the SEL-311C (e.g., IN102, IN207) are not polarity \ndependent. Refer to General Specifications on page 1.2 for optoisolated input \nratings.\n\nInputs can be configured to respond to ac or dc control signals via Global \nsettings IN101D–IN106D, IN201D–IN208D (extra I/O board Option 2, 5, \nor 6), or IN201D–IN216D (extra I/O board Option 4).\nRefer to the serial number sticker on the relay rear panel for the optoisolated \ninput voltage rating (listed under the LOGIC INPUT label).\n\nSafeLock Trip and \nClose Pushbuttons\n\nTrip and close your circuit breaker or control other devices using the optional \nSafeLock Trip and Close pushbuttons even when the relay is without power. \nProvide bright, easily visible breaker status or the status of other devices using \nthe integral breaker status LEDs. These features are electrically isolated and \nfunction independently of the rest of the relay. Figure 2.19 shows example trip \nand close circuit connections in a dc system. The SafeLock pushbuttons come \nconfigured from the factory for dc operation, with the internal arc suppressor \nenabled. SafeLock pushbuttons with the internal arc suppressor enabled will \nnot be damaged even if they are released while trip or close current is still \nflowing. See Specifications on page 1.2 for current interrupting capability. \nWhen the arc suppressor is enabled, terminal Z16(+) must have a higher voltage \npotential than terminal Z15, and terminal Z18(+) must have a higher voltage \npotential than terminal Z17.\n\nTo use an ac trip or close potential, the arc suppression must be disabled for \none or both pushbuttons. The arc suppressor should also be disabled when \nconnecting the pushbuttons to loads that do not require arc suppression, such \nas certain magnetic actuator circuit breakers.\n\nJumpers on the pushbutton board in Figure 2.24 determine if the arc \nsuppressor on the SafeLock pushbuttons is enabled or disabled. See \nSpecifications on page 1.2 for load current ratings that the pushbuttons can \nswitch without the assistance of the internal arc suppressors. \n\nThe breaker indicator LEDs are suitable for use in ac and dc systems. The \noperating voltage ranges of the LEDs are configured by jumpers as shown in \nFigure 2.24.\n\nSee Circuit Board Connections and Jumpers on page 2.23 for instructions \nregarding access to circuit board jumpers.\n\nCircuit for Charge\nCurrent Internal to SEL-311C\n\nB01\n\nB02\n\n(+)\n\n(–)\n\nB03\n\nLOAD\n\nB01\n\nB02 B03\n\n(–)\n\n(+)\n\nLOAD\n\nNOTE: The SafeLock Trip and \nClose pushbuttons are electrically \nisolated from the rest of the relay. \nTo monitor the SafeLock trip and \nclose button activity in the relay, \nwire an optoisolated input to each \ncontrolled circuit, and then \nmonitor the input state using other \nrelay functions. For example, \ninputs can be monitored using the \nSequential Events Recorder (SER) \nReport.

Only an intentional button press will \nactivate the buttons. Rotate the protective sleeve 90 degrees clockwise to lock \nthe pushbuttons. In this locked position the button cannot be pressed, and the \ntab on the protective sleeve aligns with the tab on the button base. Use the \naligned tabs to hang a lockout tag and prevent the button from being unlocked.\n\nFigure 2.9 SafeLock Trip and Close Pushbuttons\n\nDisabling the SafeLock Pushbutton Lock\nSome applications do not permit a breaker control to be locked. Set-screws on \nthe back of the button body behind the relay front panel allow you to freeze \nthe rotating protective sleeve in the unlocked position, effectively disabling \nthe locking mechanism. Follow these steps while referring to Figure 2.10 to \ndisable the locking mechanism.\n\n1. Remove the relay front panel.\n\n2. Locate the back of the button to be frozen in the unlocked \nposition. Remove either mounting screw from the back of the \nbutton. Remove the spacer from the mounting screw. Retain the \nspacer in case you wish to enable the locking mechanism in the \nfuture.\n\n3. Reseat the mounting screw removed in Step 2 without the \nspacer sleeve, being careful not to torque it past 4 in-lb. (0.5 \nNm).\n\n4. Test the button to ensure the protective sleeve will no longer \nrotate (the button cannot be locked), and that the button still \nmoves when pressed.\n\n5. Reinstall the relay front panel.\n\nFigure 2.10 Remove Spacer and Reseat Screw to Disable Locking Mechanism\n\nTo lock\n\n! CAUTION\nEnsure the button is unlocked before \nproceeding. Trying to freeze a button \nin the locked position may result in \ndamage to the button mechanism. \n\n! CAUTION\nEnsure button is in unlocked position \nbefore reseating screw. Inserting the \nscrew without the spacer with the \nbutton in the locked position will \nresult in damage to the button.\n\nRemove and\nretain spacer\n\n\n\n2.13\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nInstallation\nMaking Rear-Panel Connections\n\nCurrent Transformer \nInputs\n\nNote the polarity dots above terminals Z01, Z03, Z05, and Z07. Refer to \nFigure 2.14–Figure 2.18 for typical CT wiring examples.\n\nRefer to the serial number sticker on the relay rear panel for the nominal \ncurrent ratings (5 A or 1 A) for the phase (IA, IB, IC) and neutral (IN) current \ninputs (listed under label AMPS AC).\n\nPotential Transformer \nInputs\n\nNote the signal labels (VA, VB, VC, N, VS, NS) on terminals Z09–Z14. Figure 2.11 \nshows the internal connection for terminals VA, VB, VC, and N. Note also that \nVS-NS is a separate single-phase voltage input.\n\nVoltage Input Rating\nThe continuous voltage input rating for the SEL-311C is 300 Vac.\n\nThis voltage rating applies to the three-phase voltage inputs (VA-N, VB-N, VC-N) \nas well as to the VS-NS voltage input.\n\nWye-Connected Voltages\nAny voltage input (i.e., VA-N, VB-N, VC-N, or VS-NS) can be connected to \nvoltages as high as 300 V continuous. Figure 2.11 shows an example of \nwye-connected voltages. System frequency is determined from voltage \nconnected to voltage input VA-N. Additionally, voltage input VS-NS measures \nfrequency on the other side of an open breaker for synchronism-check \napplications. See Synchronism-Check Elements on page 3.53 and Frequency \nElements on page 3.70.\n\nSynchronism-Check VS Connection\nVoltage input VS is the voltage input for the synchronism-check elements. \nFigure 2.14–Figure 2.18 show examples of synchronism-check voltage inputs \napplied to relay terminals VS-NS. See Synchronism-Check Elements on \npage 3.53.\n\nNOTE: Three-phase \nvoltages are required for \nmany relay functions \nincluding distance elements, \ndirectional elements, fault \nlocating, and establishing \nfault type for front-panel \ntargets and event reports.\n\n\n\n2.14\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nInstallation\nMaking Communications Connections\n\nWye-Connected PT Example\n\nFigure 2.11 Wye-Connected PTs With Phase-Ground Connected \nSynchronism-Check Input\n\nMaking Communications Connections\nUSB Port The optional front-panel USB port is intended for fast local access to the relay. \n\nUse SEL cable C664 to connect a personal computer to the relay USB port. \nSee Establishing Communications Using the USB Port on page 10.2.\n\nEthernet Ports The SEL-311C is equipped with either one or two fiber-optic or twisted-pair \nrear-panel Ethernet ports.

The demodulated IRIG-B time \nsignal can come via an SEL communications processor, automation controller, \nor the SEL-2100 Logic Processor listed in Table 2.2, or from a \nsatellite-synchronized clock, such as the SEL-2407®, SEL-2404, or \nSEL-2401. The IRIG-B time signal can be connected to the rear-panel BNC \nconnector labeled IRIG, to PORT 2, or to the optional fiber-optic serial port.\n\nConnect the rear-panel BNC connector directly to a high-accuracy \nsatellite-synchronized clock such as the SEL-2407 or SEL-2401 to \nsynchronize the relay internal clock within one microsecond and enable \nhigh-accuracy synchrophasors. See Appendix N: Synchrophasors for more \ninformation on enabling and using synchrophasors in the SEL-311C. \n\nA demodulated IRIG-B time code can be input into serial PORT 2 by \nconnecting the port to an SEL communications processor or automation \ncontroller using Cable C273A.\n\nOptional fiber-optic serial Port 1 can be used to bring IRIG-B Input to the \nrelay, as shown in Figure 2.12 and Figure 2.13, or directly from the fiber-optic \nport of an SEL-2407.\n\nFigure 2.12 IRIG-B Input VIA Fiber-Optic Port 1 (SEL Communications \nProcessor or Automation Controller Source)\n\n2 SEL communications processor, \nautomation controller, or SEL-2100 \n\nwith IRIG-B\n\nC273A\n\nAll EIA-232 ports SEL-PRTU C231\n\nAll EIA-232 ports SEL-DTA2 C272A\n\n2a\n3a\n\nPort-powered modem, 5 Vdc Powered C220a\n\nAll EIA-232 ports Standard modem, 25-Pin Female (DCE) C222\na A corresponding main board jumper must be installed to power the modem with +5 Vdc \n\n(0.5 A limit) from the SEL-311C.

With a \njumper in the A position, the corresponding output contact is a Form A output \ncontact. A Form A output contact is open when the output contact coil is \nde-energized and closed when the output contact coil is energized. With a \njumper in the B position, the corresponding output contact is a Form B output \ncontact. A Form B output contact is closed when the output contact coil is \nde-energized and open when the output contact coil is energized. These \njumpers are soldered in place.\nNote that the ALARM output contact is a Form B output contact and the other \noutput contacts are all Form A output contacts. This is how these jumpers are \nconfigured in a standard relay shipment. Refer to Figure 7.28–Figure 7.30 for \nexamples of output contact operation for different output contact types. All \noutputs on the Main Board and the standard output and high-current \ninterrupting extra I/O boards are jumper configurable. Only output OUT208 \nof the Fast, High-Current Interrupting Extra I/O Board is jumper configurable. \nThis output is shipped as a Form A contact. OUT201–OUT207 are fixed \nForm A contacts. \n\n“Extra Alarm” \nOutput Contact \nControl Jumper\n\nThe SEL-311C has one output contact designated as the alarm output and \nlabeled ALARM on the relay rear panel. This output can be programmed to \naccommodate custom alarm schemes using SELOGIC control equation \nALRMOUT. See Output Contacts on page 7.33. Often more than one alarm \noutput contact is necessary for applications such as local annunciation, remote \nannunciation, or backup schemes. An extra alarm output contact can be \nprogrammed without the addition of any external hardware. Output contact \nOUT107 can be converted to operate as an “extra alarm” output contact by \nmoving a jumper on the main board.\nFigure 2.20 shows the location, function, and default factory configuration of \nJMP10, the jumper that controls OUT107. With the jumper in the OUT position, \nthe output contact operates regularly. With the jumper in the ALARM \nposition, the output contact is driven by the same signal that operates the \nALARM output contact.\n\nIf OUT107 is operating as an “extra alarm,” it is driven by the same signal that \noperates the ALARM output contact. In a standard relay shipment, OUT107 will be \nin the state opposite that of the ALARM output contact because the ALARM output \ncontact comes as a Form B output contact and all the other output contacts \n(including OUT107) come as Form A output contacts.\nThe output contact type for any output contact on the mainboard can be \nchanged (see Output Contact Jumpers). Therefore, the ALARM output contact \nand the “extra alarm” output contact can be configured as the same output \ncontact type if desired (e.g., both can be configured as Form B type output \ncontacts).\nSee Output Contacts on page 7.33 and Relay Self-Tests on page 13.7 for \ndetails on the operation and settings for the ALARM and “extra alarm” \noutputs.\n\nAccess and Breaker \nJumpers\n\nFigure 2.20 shows the location, function, and factory-default configuration for \nthe Access and Breaker Control jumpers.\nUse the Access jumper to enable access to any front-panel communications \nport, any enabled rear-panel communications ports, and the front-panel user \ninterface. When the Access jumper is installed, passwords are disabled, and \nconnection to any enabled communications port is allowed full access to \n\n! WARNING\nThe jumpers that determine if an \noutput is Form A or Form B are \nsoldered into the circuit board. Follow \nproper desoldering and soldering \nprocedures when changing those \njumpers, or return the relay to the \nfactory to have the jumpers changed.\n\n\n\n2.30\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nInstallation\nCircuit Board Connections and Jumpers\n\ninspect/change/reset all reports, settings, etc., to upgrade firmware, and to \ncontrol the circuit breaker (if the Breaker jumper is installed as described \nbelow) without password authentication.\nThe Access jumper also affects the relay behavior for settings EPORT and \nMAXACC at power-up as follows:\n\n➤ For the front-panel serial port (Port F), and the optional USB \nport, the Access jumper overrides the port enable setting \nEPORT = N, and enables the port(s) with EIA-232 Port F \ndefault settings for PROTO, SPEED, BITS, PARITY, STOP, \nand RTSCTS. If the Port F setting EPORT was already set to Y, \nthe front port(s) remain enabled, and the EIA-232 Port F uses \nits previous settings.\n\n➤ For the front-panel serial port (Port F), and the optional USB port, \nthe Access jumper overrides the Port F MAXACC setting and \nallows access to security levels 1, B, 2, or C without a password.\n\n➤ For rear-panel serial ports (Port 1, 2, or 3), and Ethernet Port 5 \nTelnet sessions, if that port has setting EPORT = Y, the Access \njumper overrides that port's MAXACC setting, and allows \naccess to security levels 1, B, 2, or C without a password.\n\n➤ For rear-panel serial ports (Port 1, 2, or 3), and Ethernet Port 5, \nif that port has setting EPORT = N, the Access jumper has no \neffect, and the port remains disabled.\n\nUse the Breaker jumper to enable or disable breaker control OPEN, CLOSE and \nPULSE commands through the SEL ASCII protocol and breaker operations \nthrough the SEL Fast Operate protocol, DNP, Modbus®, and the front-panel \nmenu-driven user interface. Note that the Breaker jumper does not supervise \noperation of Local Bits, Remote Bits, or the SafeLock Trip/Close pushbuttons.\n\nEIA-232 Serial Port \nVoltage Jumpers\n\nFigure 2.20 shows the location, function, and default factory configuration of \nthe serial port Pin 1 power jumpers. These two jumpers connect or disconnect \n+5 Vdc to Pin 1 on the corresponding EIA-232 serial ports. The +5 Vdc is \nrated at 0.5 A maximum combined for both ports. See Table 10.6 for EIA-232 \nserial port pin functions.\n\nIn a standard relay shipment, the jumpers are “OFF” (not in place) so that the \n+5 Vdc is not connected to Pin 1 on the corresponding EIA-232 serial ports. \nPut the jumpers “ON” (in place) so that +5 Vdc is connected to Pin 1 on the \ncorresponding EIA-232 serial ports.\n\nCondition of Acceptability for North American Product Safety Compliance\nTo meet product safety compliance for end-use applications in North America, \nuse an external fused rated 3 A or less in-line with the +5 Vdc source on Pin 1. \nSEL fiber-optic transceivers include a fuse that meets this requirement.\n\nSafeLock Trip/Close \nPushbutton and \nBreaker Status LED \nJumpers\n\nJumpers on the pushbutton board are used to select the proper control voltage \nfor breaker open/closed indicating LEDs on the relay front panel. Figure 2.24 \nshows the jumper locations and their functions. The jumpers come preset from \nthe factory with the voltage range set the same as the control input voltage, as \ndetermined by the part number at order time.\n\nThe voltage setting can be different for each LED. To access these jumpers, \nthe relay front cover, top cover, main board, and any Extra I/O board (if \npresent) must first be removed. See instructions and precautions in Accessing \nthe Relay Circuit Boards on page 2.23.\n\nNOTE: The Access jumper was \nformerly called the Password jumper.\n\n\n\n2.31\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nInstallation\nCircuit Board Connections and Jumpers\n\nJumpers on the pushbutton board in Figure 2.24 determine if the arc \nsuppressor on the SafeLock pushbuttons is enabled or disabled. Disable the \narc suppressor when connecting the pushbuttons to loads that do not require \narc suppression, such as certain magnetic actuator circuit breakers, or when \ncontrolling ac loads. See Specifications on page 1.2 for load current ratings \nthat the pushbuttons can switch without the assistance of the internal arc \nsuppressors. Arc suppression comes enabled from the factory.\n\nFigure 2.24 Jumper Locations for the SEL-311C SafeLock Pushbutton Board\n\nClock Battery Refer to Figure 2.20 for clock battery location (front of main board). A \nlithium battery powers the relay clock (date and time) if the external dc source \nis lost or removed. The battery is a 3 V lithium coin cell. At room temperature \n(25°C), the battery will nominally operate for 10 years at rated load.\nIf the dc source is lost or disconnected, the battery powers the clock. When the \nrelay is powered from an external source, the battery only experiences a low \nself-discharge rate. Thus, battery life can extend well beyond the nominal \n10 years because the battery rarely has to discharge after the relay is installed. \nThe battery cannot be recharged.\n\nIf the relay does not maintain the date and time after power loss, replace the \nbattery. Follow the instructions in Accessing the Relay Circuit Boards on \npage 2.23 to remove the relay main board.\n\nStep 1. Remove the battery from beneath the clip and install a new one. \nThe positive side (+) of the battery faces up.\n\nStep 2. Reassemble the relay as described in Accessing the Relay \nCircuit Boards on page 2.23.\n\nStep 3. Set the relay date and time via serial communications port or \nfront panel (see Section 10: Communications or Section 11: \nFront-Panel Interface, respectively).\n\nNOTE: With arc suppression \nenabled, the corresponding output \npolarity marks must be followed \nwhen wiring the control.\n\nCL\nOS\n\nE\nTR\n\nIP\n\nJM\nP7\n\nJM\nP8\n\nJM\nP3\n\nJM\nP4\n\nJM\nP5\n\nJM\nP6JM\n\nP2\nJM\n\nP1\n\nOP\nEN\n\nCL\nOS\n\nED\n\n24 V 110/125 V\n220/\n250 V\n\nCLOSED\nLED \n\nOPEN\nLED \n\nTRIP ARC SUPPRESSON, DC ONLYCLOSE\nARC SUPPRESS\nOFF, AC OR DC\n\nJMP7 JMP8\n\nJMP1\n\nJMP3\n\nJMP5\n\nJMP2\n\nJMP4\n\nJMP6\n\n48 V\n\nThere is danger of explosion if the \nbattery is incorrectly replaced.  \nReplace only with Ray-O-Vac® no. \nBR2335 or equivalent recommended \nby manufacturer.

Each subsection provides an explanation of the function, \nalong with a list of the corresponding settings and Relay Word bits. Logic \ndiagrams are included for many functions.\n\nThe protection functions in this section are as follows:\n\n➤ Distance Elements\n\n➤ Out-of-Step Characteristics on page 3.27\n➤ Instantaneous/Definite-Time Overcurrent Elements on \n\npage 3.35\n\n➤ Time-Overcurrent Elements on page 3.43\n\n➤ Voltage Elements on page 3.50\n\n➤ Synchronism-Check Elements on page 3.53\n\n➤ Frequency Elements on page 3.70\n\nProtection element accuracy information is listed in Specifications on page 1.2.\n\nDistance Elements\nPhase Distance \nElements\n\nThe SEL-311C relay has four independent zones of phase distance protection. \nAll zones are independently set. Zone 1 and Zone 2 are fixed to operate in the \nforward direction only. Zone 3 and Zone 4 can be set to operate in either the \nforward or reverse direction.\n\nEnable as many as four zones of phase distance elements by using the Group \nsetting E21P: \n\n➤ Select Positive-Sequence Memory Polarized Elements (Phase \nPairs) with E21P = 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n➤ Disable all phase distance elements with E21P = N.\n\nNOTE: The SEL-311C described in this \nmanual does not feature Compensator \nDistance Elements, as found in some \nother SEL-311C relays.\n\n\n\n3.2\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nDistance, Out-of-Step, Overcurrent, Voltage, Synchronism-Check, and Frequency Elements\nDistance Elements\n\nThe phase distance element outputs are M1P, M2P, M3P, and M4P for Zone 1 \nthrough Zone 4.\n\nSee Directional Control Settings on page 4.29 for details on specifying the \nZone 3 and Zone 4 direction using Group settings DIR3 and DIR4.\n\nThe SEL-311C positive-sequence memory polarized elements are arranged in \nphase pairs, MABn, MBCn, and MCAn, where n = Zone 1 through Zone 4. \nThe positive-sequence voltage polarization provides security and creates an \nexpanded mho characteristic. The phase pair distance elements operate on \nphase-to-phase, phase-to-phase-to-ground, and three-phase faults.\n\nIn SEL-311C-3 models, Zones 1–3 have subcycle distance elements based on \nincremental quantities as described in the paper “Experience With Subcycle \nOperating Time Distance Elements in Transmission Line Digital Relays” \n(Benmouyal and Zimmerman) available on the SEL web site. The subcycle \nelements operate in addition to the standard speed elements. No additional \nsettings are required.\n\nOperating Principles of Phase Distance Elements\nA digital relay mho element tests the angle between a line drop-compensated \nvoltage and a polarizing (reference) voltage using the following concepts.\nSampled currents and voltages are represented in the relay as vectors by using \nthe most recent sample as the real vector component and the sample taken one \nquarter cycle earlier as the imaginary vector component. See Figure 12.8 and \nFigure 12.9 for a description of this process.\n\n➤ If vector V1 = |V1|  1 and vector V2 = |V2|  2, then \nV1 • (V2 conjugate) = V1 • V2* = [ |V1| • |V2| ]  (1 – 2)\nThe angle of the vector quantity V1 • V2* is the test angle of \nthe mho element.\n\n➤ Test for V1 • V2* balance point at 1 – 2 = 0 degrees by \ncalculating sin (1 – 2). In a digital relay, this is done by \nexamining the sign (+ or –) of the imaginary component of V1 \n• V2*, written Im(V1 • V2*).\n\n➤ Test for V1 • V2* balance point at 1 – 2 = 90 degrees by \ncalculating cos (1 – 2). In a digital relay, this is done by \nexamining the sign (+ or –) of the real component of V1 • V2*, \nwritten Re(V1 • V2*).\n\nTable 3.1 shows the calculations used for the positive-sequence polarized mho \nelements. Notice that the positive-sequence polarized mho element equation is \nthe solution of Equation 3.1 for the quantity “|Z|,” which represents the relay \nreach at the balance point. This equation is in the form of a line \ndrop-compensated voltage and a polarizing (reference) voltage.\n\nEquation 3.1\n\nNOTE: The SEL-311C-2 provides fast \nand secure tripping but does not have \nhigh-speed distance elements.

Only the logic for AB pair is shown in detail. The logic for phase \npairs BC and CA is similar, and the outputs are shown entering the OR gate \nthat generates the phase distance element outputs M1P, M2P, M3P, and M4P.\n\nFor faults involving ground, the SEL-311C fault identification logic \ndetermines the fault type, and blocks two phase pair elements, as shown at the \nbottom of Figure 3.2 through Figure 3.4. For example, if the Fault \nIdentification Selection (FIDS) logic output FSB asserts, phase pairs AB and \nBC are blocked, and phase pair CA is allowed to operate. This functionality is \nonly available when all three breaker poles are closed, otherwise Relay Word \nbits FSA, FSB, and FSC cannot assert.\n\nThe SEL-311C phase and negative-sequence directional elements supervise \nthe phase-pair distance elements, as shown at the top of Figure 3.2 through \nFigure 3.4 (forward supervision), and in the middle of Figure 3.4 (reverse \nsupervision). Because these directional elements are defeated when Relay \nWord bit SPO is asserted, open-pole directional logic is provided for \ndirectional control during single-pole open conditions. Relay Word bits \n32SPOF and 32SPOR provide this supervision.\n\nIf a single-pole open condition is detected (SPO = logical 1), the fault \nidentification logic is disabled and Relay Word bits FSA, FSB, and FSC can \nno longer assert. In this situation, the phase pairs are disabled based on the \nphase of the open pole (Relay Word bit SPOA, SPOB, or SPOC will be \nasserted), as shown in the middle of Figure 3.2 through Figure 3.4. For \nexample, when SPOB is asserted, the MAB and MBC phase pairs are \nautomatically disabled. See Figure 5.6 for details on the pole open logic.\n\nOut-of-Step Block Differences in Mho Phase Pair Elements\nWhen EOOS = Y, the out-of-step blocking input to the mho phase pair \nelements in this model of the SEL-311C differs from that found in some other \nrelay models. The main difference is that the Zone 1 logic in Figure 3.2 does \nnot rely on the UBD (Unblock Delay) setting, but instead uses the directional \nnegative-sequence definite-time overcurrent element 67Q1T to unblock. The \nUBD timer is still used for Zones 2, 3, and 4 unblocking, along with the \nnegative-sequence instantaneous overcurrent element 50QnP and the \ndirectional control 32QF or 32QR, depending on the element. When \nEOOS = Y2, the Zone 1 elements are not treated any differently than the \nremaining zones and use the negative-sequence directional element 67QUBF \nto perform unblocking. \n\nPhase-to-Phase Current Fault Detectors (Zones 1—4)\n\nSetting Range for \nPhase-to-Phase Current \nFault Detectors \n(50PP1–50PP4)a:\n\n0.50–170.00 AP-P secondary, 0.01 A steps (5 A nominal)\n0.10–34.00 AP-P secondary, 0.01 A steps (1 A nominal)\n\nMax.

VPOLV asserts when the \nmemorized positive-sequence polarizing voltage is greater than 1 Volt. The \nSEL-311C-3 includes a similar Relay Word bit VPOLVH that is used in the \nhigh-speed distance elements.\n\nThe energy stored in the capacitance and reactance of a long transmission line \nor a line with shunt reactors takes time to dissipate when the line conductors \nare de-energized. Line-side potential transformers measure a voltage during \nthis time that can affect the positive-sequence memory voltage and other \ncalculations. The SEL-311C contains logic to detect this condition when all \nthree phases are open (3PO = logical 1) and for single-pole open situations \n(SPO = logical 1).\nIn the SEL-311C the following elements are supervised with Fault \nIdentification Selection (FIDS) logic:\n\n➤ Mho phase pair (enabled by E21P = 1–4),\n➤ Mho ground (enabled by E21MG = 1–4),\n➤ Quadrilateral Ground (enabled by E21XG = 1–4).\n\nWhen all three breaker poles are closed (SPO = logical 0 and \n3PO = logical 0), the FIDS logic identifies the faulted phase for all faults \ninvolving ground by comparing the angle between I0 and I2. For example, \nwhen FIDS selects A-phase, FSA asserts and enables A-phase ground distance \nelements and BC-phase distance elements. Distance elements BG, CG, AB, \nand CA are blocked.\n\n\n\n3.19\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nDistance, Out-of-Step, Overcurrent, Voltage, Synchronism-Check, and Frequency Elements\nDistance Elements\n\nWhen one breaker pole is open (SPO = logical 1, and one of SPOA, SPOB, or \nSPOC = logical 1) the FIDS logic is disabled. In this situation, the \npositive-sequence, negative-sequence, and zero-sequence voltage polarized \nand Channel IN current polarized directional elements are also disabled and \ndistance elements are affected as follows.\n\n➤ Two mho phase pairs are disabled, and the remaining pair runs \nwith supervision by the open-pole directional logic.\n\n➤ One mho ground phase is disabled, and the remaining two \nelements run with supervision by the open-pole directional \nlogic.\n\n➤ All quadrilateral ground elements are disabled.\n\nSee Pole-Open Logic on page 5.18 for more information on Relay Word bits \nSPO and 3PO.\n\nZone 1 Extension The SEL-311C features two Zone 1 extension schemes, selected by Group \nsetting EZ1EXT:\n\n➤ EZ1EXT = N disables Zone 1 extension, and hides the \nremaining settings.\n\n➤ EZ1EXT = Y enables the combined phase and ground Zone 1 \nextension scheme shown in Figure 3.18 and uses the settings \nshown in Table 3.5.\n\n➤ EZ1EXT = I enables the independent phase and ground Zone 1 \nextension scheme, and allows external SELOGIC control \nequations, as shown in Figure 3.19, and uses the settings \nshown in Table 3.8.\n\nZone 1 Extension is used to allow fast clearing of faults over the entire length \nof a protected line when communications-assisted tripping is not possible. \nWhen communications-assisted tripping is used, set EZ1EXT = N.\n\nZone 1 Extension Settings Validation\nFor either type of Zone 1 Extension, the relay performs the following settings \nvalidation to ensure the extended reach values are valid.\n\n➤ Zone 1 and Zone 2 reach must be defined for each enabled \ndistance element type\n\n➤ Zone 2 reach > 110% • [Zone 1 reach] • [extension multiplier]\nIf either of these checks fails, the relay or PC Software will display an error \nmessage and not accept the settings.\n\nCombined Phase and Ground Zone 1 Extension\nWhen enabled by setting EZ1EXT = Y, this function modifies the reach of all \nZone 1 distance elements by multiplier setting Z1EXTM once the circuit \nbreaker has been closed for Z1EXTD time and 3PO (or SPO) deasserts. All \nZone 1 reaches retreat to their set reach when the breaker opens and 3PO or \nSPO asserts.\n\nThe required settings are shown in Table 3.5 and the logic diagram is shown in \nFigure 3.18.\n\nThe Zone 1 reach cannot be extended if any of the following elements are \nasserted: M1P, M2P, Z1G, Z2G, 51G, or 51Q.\n\nNOTE: Because the Z1EXTD timer is \ncleared during a settings change or \ngroup change, Zone 1 extension may \nbegin immediately after the relay \ninitializes if the breaker is closed.\n\n\n\n3.20\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nDistance, Out-of-Step, Overcurrent, Voltage, Synchronism-Check, and Frequency Elements\nDistance Elements\n\nAs shown in Table 3.4, when the Relay Word bit Z1X is asserted, the relay \ninternally multiplies the Zone 1 phase and ground reach settings by the \nZ1EXTM value, and uses the resulting extended reach settings in the enabled \nZone 1 distance elements (see Figure 3.2, Figure 3.5, and Figure 3.8).

For the independent timing mode, the phase and ground \ndistance elements drive separate timers for each zone. For the common mode, the \nphase and ground distance elements both drive a common timer.\n\nSelect independent zone timing by using Relay Word bits MnPT and ZnGT (where \nn is the protection zone number) in the appropriate SELOGIC trip equation.\n\nTR = M2PT + Z2GT + 51GT + 51QT\n\nSelect common zone timing by using Relay Words bits ZnT (where n is the \nprotection zone number) in the appropriate SELOGIC trip equation.\n\nTR = Z2T + 51GT + 51QT\n\nZone 2 Sequential Time Delay Logic\nA sequential timing mode is available for the Zone 2 elements, with timing \nthat starts with the forward-set Zone 4 elements. This logic is shown at the \nbottom of Figure 3.20.\n\nThis mode requires Zone 4 to be set in the forward direction to match Zone 2. Make \nsetting DIR4 = F as discussed in Directional Control Settings on page 4.28.\n\nThis timing mode allows a weak terminal that detects a forward fault with an \noverreaching Zone 4 element to start timing for Zone 2, using the Zone 2 \ndelay settings. If the remote line terminal trips first and causes the fault current \nto redistribute, the local relay may pick up a Zone 2 element. Because the \nZone 2 sequential timer has already been partially or completely satisfied, the \nsequential timing output can be used to trip the local terminal much faster than \na regular Zone 2 timer, which would just be starting to time. This helps \nespecially in applications that do not use communications-assisted tripping.\n\nIf the Zone 2 element does not pickup, the sequential timer output cannot assert.\n\nTable 3.9 Zone Timing Settings\n\nSettings Common Timer:\nIndependent Phase Timer:\nIndependent Ground Timer:\n\nZ1D–Z4D\nZ1PD–Z4PD\nZ1GD–Z4GD\n\nRanges Pickup: OFF, 0.00–16,000.00 cycles,\n0.25-cycle steps\n\n\n\n3.25\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nDistance, Out-of-Step, Overcurrent, Voltage, Synchronism-Check, and Frequency Elements\nDistance Elements\n\nIf a fault starts out in Zone 2, the sequential timing logic output will assert at \nthe same time as the corresponding Zone 2 timers, because we expect the \nforward set Zone 4 elements to assert for any Zone 2 fault.\n\nNo additional time delay settings are required for the sequential timing logic, \nbecause the Zone 2 delay settings Z2G, Z2PD, and Z2GD are used in the \nsequential timers. The regular Zone 2 and Zone 4 timing functions use \nseparate timers, and are still operable when the sequential timing is underway.\n\nTo use the sequential timing feature, include the appropriate Relay Word bits \nZ2SEQT, M2PSEQT, or Z2GSEQT in the TR SELOGIC control equation as \nrequired for your application. \n\nExample settings using a sequential common timer.\n\nGroup 1:\n\nE21P = 4\n\nE21MG = 4 \n\nand/or\nE21ZG = 4\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nZ2D = 10.00 cycles\n\nZ4D = 30.00 cycles\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nDIR4 = F\n\nLogic 1:\nTR = Z2SEQT + Z2T + Z4T + 51GT + 51QT\n\nTRQUAL = M1P + Z1G\n\nTRCOMM = M2P + Z2G\n\nThe example TR expression includes Z2T, which covers the situation where \nthe Zone 4 element or time delay settings are somehow set incorrectly. In most \nexpected cases, we know that the Z2SEQT element will assert before the Z2T \nelement, and the fault would be cleared before the Z2T element timer could \noperate. Including the Z2T element is precautionary. \n\nThe TRCOMM setting in this example is included for discussion. If \ncommunications are available, the sequential zone timing logic would not be \nany faster, but would be a good backup if the communications were out of \nservice. \n\n\n\n3.26\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nDistance, Out-of-Step, Overcurrent, Voltage, Synchronism-Check, and Frequency Elements\nDistance Elements\n\nSuspend Timing Logic\nThe timing of each common zone timer is frozen or suspended if the timer is \ntiming and the timer input drops out. The duration of the suspension is one \ncycle. This feature prevents the timer resetting when a fault evolves (e.g., \nphase-phase to three-phase, phase-ground to phase-phase-ground). If the timer \nexpires, the suspension logic is blocked.\n\nAvailability Determined by Number of Distance Elements Enabled \nIf E21P, E21MG, and/or E21XG are set to anything but N, the common timers \nare enabled according to the lower of the two enables. For example, if E21P = \n3 and E21MG = 2, enable Z1D and Z2D (two Zones as defined by the E21MG \nsetting). \nWhen any zone time delay is set to OFF, the timer output is disabled, and the \ncorresponding delay element remains at logical 0 regardless of the distance \nelement status.\n\nThe sequential time delay element M2PSEQT requires E21P = 4.\nThe sequential time delay element Z2GSEQT requires E21MG = 4 and/or \nE21XG = 4.\n\nThe sequential time delay element Z2SEQT requires E21P = 4 and \n[E21MG = 4 and/or E21XG = 4.]\n\n\n\n3.27\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nDistance, Out-of-Step, Overcurrent, Voltage, Synchronism-Check, and Frequency Elements\nOut-of-Step Characteristics\n\nq From Figure 3.2; w from Figure 3.5; e from Figure 3.3; r from Figure 3.6; t from Figure 3.4; y from Figure 3.7.\n\nFigure 3.20 Zone Timing Elements\n\nOut-of-Step Characteristics\nThe out-of-step (OOS) detection logic detects stable or unstable power \nswings.

Refer to the SEL-421 Application Handbook and SEL-421 Reference \nManual for application ideas and guidelines.\n\nAnother general reference is the SEL Application Guide 97-13: SEL-321-5 \nRelay Out-of-Step Logic, although the terminology differs somewhat from the \nSEL-311C.\n\nOSB Settings \nDescriptions and \nLogic Diagrams\n\nThe OSB settings are summarized in Table 3.10, and the logic diagrams are \nshown in Figure 3.22, Figure 3.23, and Figure 3.24. The Relay Word bit \noutputs are listed in Table 3.14.\n\nThe timer setting UBOSBD, shown in Figure 3.22, is an adaptive setting calculated \nby the relay. This adaptive setting, which is the expected duration of the swing \nwithin the inner blinders, is based on the actual time it takes for the swing to travel \nbetween the Zone 6 and Zone 5 blinders prior to moving into inner blinders. If the \nswing stays between the inner blinders for a period longer than UBOSBD cycles, an \nunblock signal is asserted. This logic allows the distance elements to operate should \na three-phase fault occur during a swing condition.\n\nIn the SEL-311C, the user can increase the adaptive setting UBOSBD in multiples \nof setting UBOSBF. If UBOSBF is set at a multiplier of one, the relay will calculate \nthe expected time to traverse the inner blinders based on the rate at which the swing \ntransitions from Zone 6 to Zone 5. Similarly, if UBOSBF is set at a multiplier of 4, \nthe relay will multiply the adaptive time setting by four.\n\nThe SEL-311C includes OSB latching logic. This includes the one second \ndropout timer, the latch, and the UBOSB override shown in Figure 3.23. This \nfeature mimics the function performed by the SEL-421 relay OSBLTCH = Y \nsetting.\n\nTable 3.10 Out-of-Step Settings (Sheet 1 of 2)\n\nEnable Setting: EOOS = Y, Y2, N\n\nBlock Zone Settings (Zone 1–Zone 4): OOSBn = Y, N (n = 1–4)\nOut-of-Step Block Time Delay:\n\nPickup Ranges:\nOSBD\n\n0.50–8,000.00 cycles, 0.25-cycle steps\n\nEnable Out-of-Step Tripping: EOOST = N, I, O\n\nOut-of-Step Trip Time Delay:\nPickup Ranges:\n\nOSTD\n0.50–8,000.00 cycles, 0.25-cycle steps\n\nZones 5 and 6 Reactance and Resistance Elements\n\nSettings range for Zone 5 and Zone 6\nReactance Reach:\n\nX1T5 and X1T6\n0.05 to 96  sec, 0.01  steps (5 A nominal)\n0.25 to 480  sec, 0.01  steps (1 A nominal)\n\nSettings range for Zone 5 and Zone 6\nResistance Reach:\n\nR1R5 and R1R6\n0.05 to 70  sec, 0.01  steps (5 A nominal)\n0.25 to 350  sec, 0.01  steps (1 A nominal)\n\nAdvanced Settings (EADVS = Y) range for Zone 5 and Zone 6\nReactance Reach:\n\nX1B5 and X1B6\n–96 to –0.05  sec, 0.01  steps (5 A nominal)\n–480 to –0.25  sec, 0.01  steps (1 A nominal)\n\n\n\n3.29\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nDistance, Out-of-Step, Overcurrent, Voltage, Synchronism-Check, and Frequency Elements\nOut-of-Step Characteristics\n\nOut-of-Step Blocking \nof Distance Elements\n\nThe SEL-311C OSB functions are similar to the conventional Out-of-Step \nLogic of the SEL-421 relay.

These phase \nselection bits do not by themselves indicate that an out-of-step condition is \nhappening; rather, they are used in the distance element logic to steer the \nOSB1–OSB4 signals to the appropriate phase elements. \n\nIf a power swing occurs during an open-pole condition, the power swing, as \nseen by the relay, is no longer balanced. The open-pole OOS unblocking logic \ndetermines which phase is open so that the relay can correctly identify faults \nthat may occur on the closed phases during the power swing. To identify the \nopen phase, the relay calculates the angle of the ratio of the zero-sequence \ncurrent and the negative-sequence currents.\n\nFor example, if the A-phase is open, the angle of the ratio normally lies \nbetween –60 and +60 degrees. and OSBB and OSBC assert, as shown in \nFigure 3.23. If a fault now occurs on B-phase or C-phase (or both), this \nangular relationship is no longer true.

For each zone with out-of-step blocking enabled via the \nOOSB1, OOSB2, OOSB3, and OOSB4 settings, set E50Q to enable the \ncorresponding negative-sequence overcurrent element. Select \nnegative-sequence overcurrent pickup settings 50Q1P–50Q4P so that the \novercurrent element asserts for unbalanced faults within the reach of the \ncorresponding distance elements, but does not assert for load conditions. Set \nLevel 1 negative-sequence overcurrent element torque control equation \n67Q1TC = 1.\nWhen EOOS=Y, out-of-step blocking for distance Zone 1 is defeated when \nRelay Word bit 67Q1T asserts after a time delay defined by setting 67Q1D. \nAdditionally, out-of-step blocking for distance Zones 2, 3, and 4 is defeated \nafter the corresponding negative-sequence overcurrent element asserts for a \ntime delay defined by setting UBD.\n\nWhen EOOS = Y2, the relay does not use the negative-sequence overcurrent \nelements to defeat out-of-step blocking and allow phase distance and Zone 1 \nground distance elements to operate should an unbalanced fault occur during a \nswing condition. Instead, the relay uses the positive-sequence current restraint \nfactor, a2, multiplied by three times the positive-sequence current magnitude \nto supervise the 67QUBF and 67QUBR elements (see Figure 3.21 for more \ndetail). If three times the negative-sequence current magnitude exceeds this \nfactor and if the relay has made a valid directional decision (32 elements), the \nrelay asserts either the 67QUBF or the 67QUBR directional element after a \nfixed time delay of 1.5 cycles. In this manner, the relay removes out-of-step \nblocking for phase distance elements and Zone 1 ground distance elements \nduring unbalanced faults (see Figure 3.2– Figure 3.5 and Figure 3.8). \n\nq From Figure 4.20.\n\nFigure 3.21 Directional Element Signals 67QUBF and 67QUBR\n\nTable 3.11 summarizes the differences between settings EOOS = Y and \nEOOS = Y2.\n\nTable 3.11 Differences Between EOOS = Y and EOOS = Y2 Settings and \nUnblocking (Sheet 1 of 2)\n\nEOOS = Y EOOS = Y2\n\nUnblock Zone 1 67Q1T 67QUBF\nUnblock Zone 2 50Q2 67QUBF\n\n3 • |I2|\n\nq 32QF\n\na2 • 3 • |I1|\n(Setting)               \n\n_\n\n+\n\n_\n\n+|I1|\n\n0.1 • INOM\n\n67QUBF\n\nRelay\nWord\nBits\n\nRelay\nWord\nBits\n\nq 32QR\n67QUBR\n\n1.5 CYC\n\n0 CYC\n\n0 CYC\n\n0.5 CYC\n\n\n\n3.31\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nDistance, Out-of-Step, Overcurrent, Voltage, Synchronism-Check, and Frequency Elements\nOut-of-Step Characteristics\n\nUnblocking for three-phase faults is provided by Relay Word bit UBOSB \n(see Figure 3.22).\nTable 3.12, Table 3.13, and Table 3.14 summarize how the OSB signals are \nsupervised by different means depending on the distance element and the \nbreaker pole status (single-pole open = SPO condition).\n\nUnblock Zone 3 50Q3 67QUBF or 67QUBR\nUnblock Zone 4 50Q4 67QUBF or 67QUBR\nSettings E50Q, 50Q1P, 50Q2P, 50Q3P, 50Q4P, \n\n67Q1D, 67Q1TC, UBDa, UBOSBF\na2\n\na When setting EOOS = Y2, the unblock delay time is fixed at 1.5 cycles.\n\nTable 3.11 Differences Between EOOS = Y and EOOS = Y2 Settings and \nUnblocking (Sheet 2 of 2)\n\nEOOS = Y EOOS = Y2\n\nTable 3.12 OSB Blocking and Unblocking of Distance Elements (EOOS = Y, non-SPO Conditions)\n\nElement\nSetting\n\nPhase-Pairs \n(E21P = 1, 2, etc.)\n\nGround Mho \n(E21MG = 1, 2, etc.)\n\nGround Quad. \n(E21XG = 1, 2, etc.)\n\nOOSB1 = Y OSB1, unblocked by 67Q1Ta\n\na Differs from earlier SEL-311C models. 67Q1T comes from Figure 3.31.\n\nOSB1, unblocked by 67Q1Ta OSB1, unblocked by 67Q1Ta\nOOSB2 = Y OSB2, unblocked by [50Q2 AND 32QF]b asserted \n\nlonger than UBD timer setting\n\nb Differs from earlier SEL-311C models. 32QF/32QR come from Figure 4.20.\n\nNotec\n\nc Element unaffected by OSB logic.\n\nNotec\n\nOOSB3 = Y \n(DIR3 = F/R)\n\nOSB3, unblocked by [50Q3 AND (32QF/32QR)]b \nasserted longer than UBD timer setting\n\nNotec Notec\n\nOOSB4 = Y \n(DIR4 = F/R)\n\nOSB4, unblocked by [50Q4 AND (32QF/32QR)]b \nasserted longer than UBD timer setting\n\nNotec Notec\n\nTable 3.13 OSB Blocking and Unblocking of Distance Elements (EOOS = Y2, non-SPO Conditions)\n\nElement\nSetting\n\nPhase-Pairs \n(E21P = 1, 2, etc.)\n\nGround Mho \n(E21MG = 1, 2, etc.)\n\nGround Quad. \n(E21XG = 1, 2, etc.)\n\nOOSB1 = Y OSB1, unblocked by 67QUBF OSB1, unblocked by 67QUBF OSB1, unblocked by 67QUBF\nOOSB2 = Y OSB2, unblocked by 67QUBF Notea\n\na Element unaffected by OSB logic.\n\nNotea\n\nOOSB3 = Y \n(DIR3 = F/R)\n\nOSB3, unblocked by 67QUBF/67QUBR Notea Notea\n\nOOSB4 = Y \n(DIR4 = F/R)\n\nOSB4, unblocked by 67QUBF/67QUBR Notea Notea\n\nTable 3.14 OSB Blocking and Unblocking of Distance Elements (SPO Conditions)\n\nElement\nSetting\n\nPhase-Pairs \n(E21P = 1, 2, etc.)\n\nGround Mho \n(E21MG = 1, 2, etc.)\n\nGround Quad. \n(E21XG = 1, 2, etc.)\n\nOOSB1 = Y OSB1, unblocked by open-pole OSB unblock logic OSB1, unblocked by \nopen-pole OSB unblock logic\n\nElement disabled by SPO\n\nOOSB2 = Y OSB2, unblocked by open-pole OSB unblock logic OSB2, unblocked by \nopen-pole OSB unblock logic\n\nElement disabled by SPO\n\nOOSB3 = Y \n(DIR3 = F/R)\n\nOSB3, unblocked by open-pole OSB unblock logic OSB3, unblocked by \nopen-pole OSB unblock logic\n\nElement disabled by SPO\n\nOOSB4 = Y \n(DIR4 = F/R)\n\nOSB4, unblocked by open-pole OSB unblock logic OSB4, unblocked by \nopen-pole OSB unblock logic\n\nElement disabled by SPO\n\n\n\n3.32\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nDistance, Out-of-Step, Overcurrent, Voltage, Synchronism-Check, and Frequency Elements\nOut-of-Step Characteristics\n\nOut-of-Step Trip The SEL-311C out-of-step trip function is enabled by setting EOOST = O for \noutgoing (trip on the way out of Zone 5) or I for incoming (trip on the way in \nto Zone 5) swings.

The different levels are enabled with the E50G enable \nsetting, as shown in Figure 3.30.\n\nIn Figure 3.30 the Level 1 (67G1) and Level 2 (67G2) elements have their \ndirectional control fixed forward. Levels 3 and 4 have selectable forward or \nreverse directional controls. See Directional Control Settings on page 4.28 for \ndetails on specifying the Zone 3 and Zone 4 direction using Group settings \nDIR3 and DIR4.\n\nThe Level 2 residual ground directional overcurrent element 67G2 is used in \nthe trip logic, as shown in Figure 5.1.\n\nDuring most single-pole open (SPO) conditions, the open-pole directional \nelement remains operational, as do directional control signals 32GF and 32GR \n(see Figure 4.18).\nThe single-pole open situation creates an unbalanced load that may cause the \nresidual current (3I0) magnitude to be approximately equal to the remaining \n(closed breaker pole) phase magnitudes. Depending on the load conditions of \nthe system, and the sensitivity of settings 50G1P–50G4P, elements \n50G1–50G4, 67G1–67G4, or 67G1T–67G4T may assert during a single-pole \nopen condition when no fault is present on the closed phases.

An example logic setting follows:\n\n51QTC = !SPO * other torque control conditions\n\nIf the application requires the negative-sequence time overcurrent element to \nremain active during SPO conditions, and if the auto-reclose feature is being \nused, the open interval time settings (79OI1, 79OI2, etc.) that may follow a \nsingle-pole trip should be coordinated with the 51Q element settings. For \nexample, increasing the time-dial setting (51QTD) or changing the curve \nsetting (51QC) can make the 51QT element less likely to assert for brief SPO \nconditions. See Reclosing Relay on page 6.16 for details on the SEL-311C \nauto-reclose functions.\n\nDirectional Control Method\n\nThe negative-sequence time-overcurrent element 51QT is nondirectional. In \napplications where directionality is required, see Overcurrent Directional Control \nProvided by Torque Control Settings on page 4.38.

The angle settings are checked for \nsynchronism-check closing.\n\nIf the voltages are not static (voltages slipping with respect to one another), \nthe two synchronism-check elements operate as shown in the bottom of \nFigure 3.39. The angle difference is compensated by breaker close time, and \nthe breaker is ideally closed at a zero degree phase angle difference, to \nminimize system shock.\n\nThese synchronism-check elements are explained in detail in the following \ntext.\n\nSynchronism-Check \nElements Settings\n\nSetting SYNCP The angle setting choices (0, 30, …, 300, or 330 degrees) for setting SYNCP \nare referenced to VA, and they indicate how many degrees VS constantly lags \nVA. In any synchronism-check application, voltage input VA-N always has to be \nconnected to determine system frequency on one side of the circuit breaker (to \ndetermine the slip between VS and VA). VA always has to meet the “healthy \nvoltage” criteria (settings 25VHI, 25VLO, and 25RCF—see Figure 3.38). \nThus, for situations where VS cannot be in phase with VA, VB, or VC, it is \nmost straightforward to have the angle setting choices (0, 30, …, 300, or 330 \ndegrees) referenced to VA.\n\nVoltage Input VS Connected Phase-to-Phase or Beyond Delta-Wye \nTransformer\n\nSometimes synchronism-check voltage VS cannot be in phase with voltage \nVA, VB, or VC.

The voltage across terminals VB-N is synchronism-checked \nwith the voltage across terminals VS-NS (see Figure 2.16–Figure 2.18).\n\nSystem Frequencies Determined from Voltages VA and VS\nTo determine slip frequency, the relay determines the system frequencies on \nboth sides of the circuit breaker. Voltage VS determines the frequency on one \nside. Voltage VA determines the frequency on the other side. Thus, voltage \nterminals VA-N have to be connected, even if another voltage (e.g., voltage VB) \nis to be synchronized with voltage VS.\n\nIn most applications, all three voltage inputs VA, VB, and VC are connected to the \nthree-phase power system and no additional connection concerns are needed for \nvoltage connection VA-N. The presumption is that the frequency determined for \nA-phase is also valid for B- and C-phase in a three-phase power system.\n\nHowever, for example, if voltage VB is to be synchronized with voltage VS \nand plans were to connect only voltage terminals VB-N and VS-NS then voltage \nterminals VA-N will also have to be connected for frequency determination. If \ndesired, voltage terminals VA-N can be connected in parallel with voltage \nterminals VB-N. In such a nonstandard parallel connection, remember that \nvoltage terminals VA-N are monitoring Phase B. This understanding helps \nprevent confusion when observing metering and event report information or \nvoltage element operation.\n\nAnother possible solution to this example (synchronism-check voltage input \nVS-NS connected to VB) is to make setting SYNCP = 120 (the number of degrees \nthat synchronism-check voltage VS constantly lags voltage VA) and connect \nvoltage input VA-N to VA. Voltage inputs VB and VC do not have to be connected.\n\nSystem Rotation Can Affect Setting SYNCP\nThe solution in the preceding paragraph presumes ABC system rotation. If \nvoltage input connections are the same, but system rotation is ACB, then \nsetting SYNCP = 240 degrees (VS constantly lags VA by 240°). See SEL \nApplication Guide AG2002-02, Compensate for Constant Phase Angle \nDifference in Synchronism Check with the SEL-351 Relay Family for more \ninformation on setting SYNCP with an angle setting.\n\n➤ Voltage input VA connected to Phase A\n\n➤ Voltage input VS connected to Phase B\n\n➤ Setting SYNCP = 120 degrees (VS constantly lags VA by 120°)\n\n\n\n3.59\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nDistance, Out-of-Step, Overcurrent, Voltage, Synchronism-Check, and Frequency Elements\nSynchronism-Check Elements\n\nSynchronism-Check \nElements Operation\n\nRefer to Figure 3.38 and Figure 3.39.\n\nVoltage Window and SYNCP Settings Example\n\nFigure 3.40 Example System With Synchronism-Check Voltage Connected Phase-To-Phase\n\nThe example system in Figure 3.40 illustrates two problems at one time:\n\n➤ There are different voltage connections between VP (= VA) \nand VS.\n\n➤ There are different PT ratios between VP (= VA) and VS.\nThe SEL-311C has settings to simplify the use of synchronism-check \nelements on this example system.\n\nUse SYNCP to Account for Voltage Angle Differences\nIn the Figure 3.40 example, voltage input VA-N is connected phase-to-neutral \non one side of the breaker, but synchronism-check voltage input VS-NS is \nconnected phase-to-phase on the other side of the breaker. When the circuit \nbreaker is closed (representing an ideal synchronism-check condition) the \nresultant voltage VS constantly lags voltage VA by 90° for a system with ABC \nphase rotation. Thus, setting SYNCP is set:\n\nSYNCP = 90\n\nThe SYNCP = 90 setting accounts for this constant 90° phase angle difference \n(voltage VS lags voltage VA) in checking synchronism between voltage VA \nand voltage VS.\n\nThe SYNCP setting can bet set in 30° increments, from 0° to 330°, to handle various \nconnection combinations. For more examples, see SEL Application Guide \nAG2002-02, Compensate for Constant Phase Angle Difference in Synchronism \nCheck with the SEL-351 Relay Family, available on the SEL website.\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nC B\n\nVA\n\nV\nA\n\nV\nS\n\nN\n\nVS 1:150\n\n90°\n\nV\nBC\n\n = 24.942 kV\nnominal \nphase-to-phase\n\nV\nA\n = 14.400 kV\n\nnominal \nphase-to-neutral\n\nSetting\nSYNCP = 90°\n(V\n\nS\n lags V\n\nA\n)\n\n120:1\n\nA\n\nNS\nSEL-311C\n\n120.00 V \nnominal\n\n166.28 V \nnominal\n\n52\n\n\n\n3.60\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nDistance, Out-of-Step, Overcurrent, Voltage, Synchronism-Check, and Frequency Elements\nSynchronism-Check Elements\n\nUse 25RCF to Account for Voltage Magnitude Differences\n\nIn the Figure 3.40 example, the voltage sources have different nominal \nmagnitudes. Part of the difference is from the connection type \n(phase-to-neutral versus phase-to-phase), and part of the difference is from the \nPT ratios (120:1 vs. 150:1).\nTo determine the required ratio correction, it is easiest to express the voltages \nin secondary units:\n\nThe SEL-311C provides a ratio-correction factor setting, 25RCF, to scale the \nVA voltage to the VS voltage base. The synchronism-check “healthy voltage” \nwindow settings may then be represented on the common scaling base. \n\nThe required ratio correction factor setting may be calculated from the \nnominal voltages:\n\nThe setting range for 25RCF is 0.50 to 2.00. If the calculated correction factor \nfalls outside the 25RCF setting range, consider changing potential transformer \ntaps or using auxiliary PTs to bring one or both of the voltage signals to a \ndifferent base. Additionally, the expected input voltages must be kept within \nthe relay voltage input ratings, as listed in Specifications on page 1.2.\nFor this example, the desired operation range for the synchronism-check logic \nis the nominal voltage plus or minus 10%.

If both voltages are within the \nvoltage window, the following Relay Word bits assert.\n\n59VP indicates that voltage VP (ratio corrected) is within voltage window \nsetting limits 25VLO and 25VHI\n\n59VS indicates that voltage VS is within voltage window setting limits \n25VLO and 25VHI\n\nAs discussed previously, voltage VA determines the frequency on the voltage \nVP side of the circuit breaker. Voltage VA (ratio corrected) is also run through \nvoltage limits 25VLO and 25VHI to assure “healthy voltage” for frequency \ndetermination, with corresponding Relay Word bit output 59VA.\n\nOther Uses for Voltage Window Elements\nIf voltage limits 25VLO and 25VHI are applicable to other control schemes, \nRelay Word bits 59VP, 59VS, and 59VA can be used in other logic at the same \ntime they are used in the synchronism-check logic.\n\nIf synchronism check is not being used, Relay Word bits 59VP, 59VS, and \n59VA can still be used in other logic, with voltage limit settings 25VLO and \n25VHI set as desired. Enable the synchronism-check logic (setting E25 = Y) \nand make settings 25VLO, 25VHI, and 25RCSF. Apply Relay Word bits \n59VP, 59VS, and 59VA in desired logic scheme, using SELOGIC control \nequations. Even though synchronism-check logic is enabled, the \nsynchronism-check logic outputs (Relay Word bits SF, SFAST, SSLOW, \n25A1, and 25A2) do not need to be used.\n\nBlock Synchronism-Check Conditions\nRefer to Figure 3.38.\n\nThe synchronism-check element slip frequency calculator runs if both \nvoltages VP and VS are healthy (59VP and 59VS asserted to logical 1) and the \nSELOGIC control equation setting BSYNCH (Block Synchronism Check) is \ndeasserted (= logical 0). Setting BSYNCH is most commonly set to block \nsynchronism-check operation when the circuit breaker is closed (synchronism \ncheck is only needed when the circuit breaker is open).\n\nBSYNCH = 52AA + 52AB + 52AC (see Figure 6.2)\nor \n\nBSYNCH = !3PO (see Figure 5.6)\nThese example settings allow the synch-check elements to operate only when \nall three breaker poles are open. Synchronism check during single-pole open \nconditions (SPO = logical 1) is not possible if voltage VA or VP loses \npotential.\n\n\n\n3.63\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nDistance, Out-of-Step, Overcurrent, Voltage, Synchronism-Check, and Frequency Elements\nSynchronism-Check Elements\n\nIn addition, synchronism-check operation can be blocked when the relay is \ntripping.\n\nBSYNCH = ... + TRIP\n\nSlip Frequency Calculator\nRefer to Figure 3.38.\n\nThe synchronism-check element Slip Frequency Calculator in Figure 3.38 \nruns if voltages VP, VS, and VA are healthy (59VP, 59VS, and 59VA asserted \nto logical 1) and the SELOGIC control equation setting BSYNCH (Block \nSynchronism Check) is deasserted (= logical 0). The Slip Frequency \nCalculator output is defined below.\n\nSlip Frequency = fP – fS (in units of Hz = slip cycles/second)\nfP = frequency of voltage VP (in units of Hz = cycles/second) [determined \nfrom VA]\nfS = frequency of voltage VS (in units of Hz = cycles/second)\n\nA complete slip cycle is one single 360-degree revolution of one voltage (e.g., \nVS) by another voltage (e.g., VP). Both voltages are thought of as revolving \nphasor-wise, so the “slipping” of VS past VP is the relative revolving of VS \npast VP.\n\nFor example, in Figure 3.38, if voltage VP has a frequency of 59.95 Hz and \nvoltage VS has a frequency of 60.05 Hz, the difference between them is the \nslip frequency.\n\nSlip Frequency = 59.95 Hz – 60.05 Hz = –0.10 Hz = –0.10 slip \ncycles/second\n\nThe slip frequency in this example is negative, indicating that voltage VS is \nnot “slipping” behind voltage VP, but in fact “slipping” ahead of voltage VP. \nIn a time period of one second, the angular distance between voltage VP and \nvoltage VS changes by 0.10 slip cycles, which translates into\n\n0.10 slip cycles/second • (360°/slip cycle) • 1 second = 36°\nThus, in a time period of one second, the angular distance between voltage VP \nand voltage VS changes by 36 degrees.\n\nThe absolute value of the Slip Frequency output is run through a comparator \nand if the slip frequency is less than the maximum slip frequency setting, \n25SF, Relay Word bit SF asserts to logical 1.\n\nThe SF Relay Word bit may not operate if the VP (= VA) frequency is \nchanging too quickly. This will not be an issue when the synchronism-check \nelements are being used to verify phase alignment across breakers in \ntransmission systems with multiple paths. However, if one side of the circuit \nbreaker is expected to vary in frequency (perhaps it is connected to an intertie \nline) the best configuration for using the synchronism-check element is to \nconnect the VA, VB, VC terminals (and thus VP) to the more stable system \n(e.g., the power grid), while the VS terminal (VS) is connected to the intertie \nwith the smaller power system.\n\nGenerator Application for SSLOW and SFAST\nRelay Word bits SSLOW and SFAST in Figure 3.38 indicate the relative slip \nof voltages VP (= VA), and VS.\n\n\n\n3.64\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nDistance, Out-of-Step, Overcurrent, Voltage, Synchronism-Check, and Frequency Elements\nSynchronism-Check Elements\n\nThe SFAST, SSLOW, and SF operation over various slip frequencies is \nsummarized in Table 3.24 and Figure 3.42.\n\nq Slip Frequency = Frequency of VA-N signal—Frequency of VS-NS signal w From \nFigure 3.38.\n\nFigure 3.42 Graphical Depiction of SFAST, SSLOW, and SF Operation Range\n\nAn application idea for SSLOW and SFAST is a small generator installation.\n\nWith some logic (perhaps to create pulsing signals), SSLOW and SFAST \nmight be used as signals (via output contacts) to the generator governor. \nSSLOW indicates that the VP (=VA) frequency is lower than the VS \nfrequency, while SFAST indicates that the VP (=VA) frequency is higher \nthan the VS frequency. If the enable into the slip frequency calculator in \nFigure 3.38 is disabled (e.g., SELOGIC setting BSYNCH asserts because \nthe breaker closes; BSYNCH = 52A + …), then both SSLOW = logical 0 \nand SFAST = logical 0, regardless of slip frequency.\n\nThe SEL-311C SSLOW and SFAST outputs are available over a larger slip \nfrequency range than the synchronism-check element, and are independent of \nthe SF Relay Word bit. If the slip frequency is greater than the 25SF setting, \nRelay Word bit SF will be deasserted (logical 0), and one of the SSLOW or \nSFAST Relay Word bits may operate to indicate the polarity of the slip \nfrequency.\n\nTable 3.24 SSLOW and SFAST Relay Word Bit Operating Range\n\nSlip Frequency Range Relay Word Bit SSLOW Relay Word Bit SFAST\n\n(fP–fS)  –0.005 Hz logical 1 logical 0\n–0.005 < (fP–fS) < 0.005 logical 0 logical 0\n\n(fP–fS)  0.005 Hz logical 0 logical 1\n\nSlip\nFrequency \n\n(Hz)\n\n(Slip > 0)\n\n(Slip < 0)\n\n+25SF\n(setting)\n\n—25SF\n(setting)\n\nSystems are static\n\nSystems are slipping\n\nSystems are slipping\n\nSystems are slipping\n\nSystems are slipping\n\n+0.005\n\n0.000\n\n—0.005\n\nq\n\nw\n\nw\n\nw\n\nSSLOW = 1\n\nSF = 1\n\nSFAST = 1\n\n\n\n3.65\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nDistance, Out-of-Step, Overcurrent, Voltage, Synchronism-Check, and Frequency Elements\nSynchronism-Check Elements\n\nThe SSLOW and SFAST Relay Word bits may not operate reliably if the VP \n(= VA) frequency is changing too quickly. The best configuration for using the \nSSLOW and SFAST outputs is when the VA, VB, VC terminals (and thus VP) \nare connected to the most stable system (e.g., the power grid), while the VS \nterminal (VS) is connected to the “machine” side of the circuit breaker.\n\nAngle Difference Calculator\nThe synchronism-check element Angle Difference Calculator in Figure 3.39 \nruns if the slip frequency is less than the maximum slip frequency setting \n25SF (Relay Word bit SF is asserted).\n\nVoltages VP and VS Are “Static”\nRefer to top of Figure 3.39.\n\nIf the absolute value of the slip frequency is less than 0.005 Hz, the Angle \nDifference Calculator does not take into account breaker close time—it \npresumes voltages VP and VS are “static” (not “slipping” with respect to one \nanother). This would usually be the case for an open breaker with voltages VP \nand VS that are paralleled via some other electric path in the power system. \nThe Angle Difference Calculator calculates the angle difference between \nvoltages VP and VS.\n\nAngle Difference = |(VP – VS)|\nFor example, if SYNCP = 90 (indicating VS constantly lags VP = VA by \n90 degrees), but VS actually lags VA by 100 angular degrees on the power \nsystem at a given instant, the Angle Difference Calculator automatically \naccounts for the 90 degrees.\n\nAngle Difference = |( VP –  VS)| = 10°\nAlso, if breaker close time setting TCLOSD = 0.00, the Angle Difference \nCalculator does not take into account breaker close time, even if the voltages \nVP and VS are “slipping” with respect to one another. Thus, \nsynchronism-check elements 25A1 or 25A2 assert to logical 1 if the Angle \nDifference is less than corresponding maximum angle setting 25ANG1 or \n25ANG2, and the slip frequency is below setting 25SF.\n\nVoltages VP and VS Are “Slipping”\nRefer to bottom of Figure 3.39.\n\nIf the absolute value of the slip frequency is greater than or equal to 0.005 Hz \nand breaker close time setting TCLOSD  0.00, the Angle Difference \nCalculator takes the breaker close time into account with breaker close time \nsetting TCLOSD (set in cycles; see Figure 3.43). The Angle Difference \nCalculator calculates the Angle Difference between voltages VP and VS, \ncompensated with the breaker close time.\n\nAngle Difference = |(VP – VS) + [(fP – fS) • TCLOSD • (1/NFREQ) • \n(360°/slip cycle)]|\n\nNFREQ is the Global setting that defines the nominal system frequency as \n50 or 60 Hz.\n\n\n\n3.66\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nDistance, Out-of-Step, Overcurrent, Voltage, Synchronism-Check, and Frequency Elements\nSynchronism-Check Elements\n\nFigure 3.43 Angle Difference Between VP and VS Compensated by Breaker \nClose Time (fP < fS and VP shown as reference in this example)\n\nAngle Difference Example (Voltages VP and VS Are “Slipping”)\nRefer to bottom of Figure 3.39.\n\nFor example, for a 60 Hz nominal system, if the breaker close time is \n10 cycles, set TCLOSD = 10 and NFREQ = 60.

This 6 degree angle \ncompensation is applied to voltage VS, resulting in derived voltage VS*, as \nshown in Figure 3.43.\n\nThe top of Figure 3.43 shows the Angle Difference decreasing—VS* is \napproaching VP. Ideally, circuit breaker closing is initiated when VS* is in \nphase with VP (Angle Difference = 0 degrees). Then when the circuit breaker \nmain contacts finally close, VS is in phase with VP, minimizing system shock.\n\nThe bottom of Figure 3.43 shows the Angle Difference increasing—VS* is \nmoving away from VP. Ideally, circuit breaker closing is initiated when VS* is \nin phase with VP (Angle Difference = 0 degrees). Then when the circuit \nbreaker main contacts finally close, VS is in phase with VP. But in this case, \nVS* has already moved past VP. In order to initiate circuit breaker closing \nwhen VS* is in phase with VP (Angle Difference = 0 degrees), VS* has to slip \naround another revolution, relative to VP.\n\nSynchronism-Check Element Outputs\nSynchronism-check element outputs (Relay Word bits 25A1 and 25A2 in \nFigure 3.39) assert to logical 1 for the conditions explained in the following \ntext.\n\nVoltages VP and VS Are “Static” or Setting TCLOSD = 0.00\nRefer to the top of Figure 3.39.\n\nIf VP and VS are “static” (not “slipping” with respect to one another), the \nAngle Difference between them remains constant—it is not possible to close \nthe circuit breaker at an ideal zero degree phase angle difference. Thus, \nsynchronism-check elements 25A1 or 25A2 assert to logical 1 if the Angle \nDifference is less than the corresponding maximum angle setting 25ANG1 or \n25ANG2.\n\nAlso, if breaker close time setting TCLOSD = 0.00, the Angle Difference \nCalculator does not take into account breaker close time, even if the voltages \nVP and VS are “slipping” with respect to one another. Thus, \nsynchronism-check elements 25A1 or 25A2 assert to logical 1 if the Angle \nDifference is less than the corresponding maximum angle setting 25ANG1 or \n25ANG2 and the slip frequency is below setting 25SF.\n\nVoltages VP and VS Are “Slipping” and Setting TCLOSD  0.00\nRefer to bottom of Figure 3.39. If VP and VS are “slipping” with respect to \none another and breaker close time setting TCLOSD  0.00, the Angle \nDifference (compensated by breaker close time TCLOSD) changes through \ntime. Synchronism-check element 25A1 or 25A2 asserts to logical 1 for any \none of the following three scenarios.\n\n1. The top of Figure 3.43 shows the Angle Difference \ndecreasing—VS* is approaching VP. When VS* is in phase \nwith VP (Angle Difference = 0 degrees), synchronism-check \nelements 25A1 and 25A2 assert to logical 1.\n\n2. The bottom of Figure 3.43 shows the Angle Difference \nincreasing—VS* is moving away from VP. VS* was in phase \nwith VP (Angle Difference = 0 degrees), but has now moved \npast VP. If the Angle Difference is increasing, but the Angle \nDifference is still less than maximum angle settings 25ANG1 \n\nNOTE: The angle compensation in \nFigure 3.43 appears much greater \nthan 6 degrees. Figure 3.43 is for \ngeneral illustrative purposes only.\n\n\n\n3.68\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nDistance, Out-of-Step, Overcurrent, Voltage, Synchronism-Check, and Frequency Elements\nSynchronism-Check Elements\n\nor 25ANG2, then corresponding synchronism-check elements \n25A1 or 25A2 assert to logical 1.\n\nIn this scenario of the Angle Difference increasing, but still \nbeing less than maximum angle settings 25ANG1 or 25ANG2, \nthe operation of corresponding synchronism-check elements \n25A1 and 25A2 becomes less restrictive. Synchronism-check \nbreaker closing does not have to wait for voltage VS* to slip \naround again in phase with VP (Angle Difference = 0 degrees). \nThere might not be enough time to wait for this to happen. \nThus, the “Angle Difference = 0 degrees” restriction is eased \nfor this scenario.\n\n3. Refer to Reclose Supervision Logic on page 6.5.\n\nRefer to the bottom of Figure 6.4. If timer 79CLSD is set \ngreater than zero (e.g., 79CLSD = 60.00 cycles) and it times \nout without SELOGIC control equation setting 79CLS (Reclose \nSupervision) asserting to logical 1, the relay goes to the \nLockout State (see top of Figure 6.5).\nRefer to the top of Figure 6.4. If timer 79CLSD is set to zero \n(79CLSD = 0.00), SELOGIC control equation setting 79CLS \n(Reclose Supervision) is checked only once to see if it is \nasserted to logical 1. If it is not asserted to logical 1, the relay \ngoes to the Lockout State.\n\nRefer to the top of Figure 3.43. Ideally, circuit breaker closing \nis initiated when VS* is in phase with VP (Angle Difference = 0 \ndegrees). Then when the circuit breaker main contacts finally \nclose, VS is in phase with VP, minimizing system shock. But \nwith time limitations imposed by timer 79CLSD, this may not \nbe possible. To try to avoid going to the Lockout State, the \nfollowing logic is employed:\n\nIf 79CLS has not asserted to logical 1 while timer \n79CLSD is timing (or timer 79CLSD is set to zero and \nonly one check of 79CLS is made), the \nsynchronism-check logic at the bottom of Figure 3.39 \nbecomes less restrictive at the “instant” timer 79CLSD \nis going to time out (or make the single check). It drops \nthe requirement of waiting until the decreasing Angle \nDifference (VS* approaching VP) brings VS* in phase \nwith VP (Angle Difference = 0 degrees). Instead, it just \nchecks to see that the Angle Difference is less than \nangle settings 25ANG1 or 25ANG2.\nIf the Angle Difference is less than angle setting \n25ANG1 or 25ANG2, then the corresponding Relay \nWord bit, 25A1 or 25A2, asserts to logical 1 for that \n“instant” (asserts for 1/4 cycle).\nFor example, if SELOGIC control equation setting \n79CLS (Reclose Supervision) is set as follows:\n\n79CLS = 25A1 + ...\n\nand the angle difference is less than angle setting \n25ANG1 at that “instant,” setting 79CLS asserts to \nlogical 1 for 1/4 cycle, allowing the sealed-in open \ninterval time-out to propagate on to the close logic in \nFigure 6.3. Element 25A2 operates similarly.\n\n\n\n3.69\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nDistance, Out-of-Step, Overcurrent, Voltage, Synchronism-Check, and Frequency Elements\nSynchronism-Check Elements\n\nSynchronism-Check \nApplications for \nAutomatic Reclosing \nand Manual Closing\n\nRefer to Close Logic on page 6.2 and Reclose Supervision Logic on page 6.5.\n\nFor example, set 25ANG1 = 15 degrees and use the resultant \nsynchronism-check element in the reclosing relay logic to supervise automatic \nreclosing.\n\n79CLS = 25A1 + SPO + … (see Figure 6.6 and Figure 5.6)\nThe synchronism-check elements may not be available during a single-pole \nopen condition (SPO = logical 1). The SPO term allows an automatic reclose \nduring SPO conditions.\n\nSet 25ANG2 = 25° and use the resultant synchronism-check element in \nmanual close logic to supervise manual closing (for example, assert IN106 or \nissue the CLO command to initiate manual close) as shown below.\n\nSV1 = (/IN106 + CC) * !TRIP + SV1 * !SV1T * !TRIP * !CLOSE\n\nCL = (SV1 * 25A2 + SV1 * SPO + …) (see Figure 6.5 and Figure 5.6)\nThe SPO term allows a manual close during SPO conditions, when 25A2 may \nbe unavailable.\n\nSet SV1PU = N cycles, and SV1DO = 0.00 cycles. Choose N to represent the \nmaximum period that a manual close may be attempted. A typical setting for \nN might be 50 to 600 cycles (approximately 1 to 10 seconds).\nThe timer effectively stretches the one processing interval CC pulse (asserted by the \nCLOSE command, or via DNP, Modbus®, or SEL Fast Operate protocols—see \nSection 10) to improve the chances of closing if the synch check element is not \nasserted at the instant the command is received. Other possible inputs to initiate \nmanual closing include using a local bit (/LBn) or remote bit (/RBn), or \nprogrammable operator control bit (PBnPUL), when available.\nThe rising edge operator “/” on IN106 prevents a maintained assertion to \nlogical 1 from creating a standing close condition. The !TRIP terms defeat the \nmanual close window if a relay trip is detected. The !CLOSE term cancels the \ntiming once the close logic is activated. Other conditions could be added to \ndefeat the manual close.\n\nIn this example, the angular difference across the circuit breaker can be \ngreater for a manual close (25 degrees) than for an automatic reclose \n(15 degrees).\nA single output contact (e.g., OUT102 = CLOSE) can provide the close \nfunction for both automatic reclosing and manual closing (see Figure 6.3 logic \noutput).\n\nTesting \nSynchronism-Check \nElements\n\nThe energy stored in the capacitance and reactance of a long transmission line \ntakes time to dissipate, or ringdown, when the line conductors are \nde-energized. The SEL-311C contains logic to detect this condition, block \nfrequency measurement, and cause Relay Word bit FREQOK to deassert. This \nprevents operation of the synchronism-check elements. When testing these \nelements, prevent operation of the ringdown detection by using one of the \nfollowing methods.\n\n1. Apply balanced three-phase voltages with magnitude close to \nGroup setting VNOM.\n\n2.

When determining the time delay settings appropriate for an \napplication, keep in mind that the power system frequency will not be at the nominal \nvalue (50 Hz or 60 Hz) when an overfrequency or underfrequency element \ntimes-out. The relay adjusts the processing algorithms to track the system frequency, \nand this can make the time delay seem shorter or longer than anticipated.\n\nFor pickup settings that are close to the nominal frequency, or with short \nduration delays, the nominal frequency may be used to convert the desired \ntime delay from seconds into cycles with negligible error.\n\nHowever, for elements that have pickup settings (81DnP) set further from the \nnominal frequency, or elements set with long time delays (81DnD), the over- or \nunderfrequency pickup setting may be used for the time-base conversion instead.\n\nThe observed time delay will depend on the frequency of the power system or \ntest set during the excursion, and whether the frequency change is applied as \nstep-change, a ramp, or some other function.\n\nOverfrequency Element Settings Example\nOn a 60 Hz nominal system, the planner requires an overfrequency trip to \noccur if the frequency exceeds 60.60 Hz for 30 seconds.\n\nNOTE: Refer to Figure 3.45.\n\n\n\n3.74\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nDistance, Out-of-Step, Overcurrent, Voltage, Synchronism-Check, and Frequency Elements\nFrequency Elements\n\nConvert the time delay from seconds to cycles using the pickup setting.\n\nRequired settings.\n81D1P = 60.60 Hz\n\n81D1D = 1818.00 cycles\n\nUsing the example settings, if a 60.80 Hz signal is applied for testing, the \nSEL-311C would be expected to assert 81D1T approximately \n\n1818 cycles / 60.80 cycles/s = 29.90 s \n\nafter the instantaneous element (81D1) pickup.\nIf the nominal frequency 60 Hz conversion factor has been used instead, the \ntime delay setting would have been 1800 cycles, and the same 60.80 Hz test \nsignal would be expected to assert 81D1T approximately 1800 cycles / 60.80 \ncycles/s = 29.61 s after the instantaneous element (81D1) pickup. \nIn this test example, the time delay settings adjustment improves the timing \naccuracy by about 1 percent.\n\nFrequency Element Voltage Control\nRefer to Figure 3.44 and Figure 3.45.\n\nNote that all six frequency elements are controlled by the same undervoltage \nelement (Relay Word bit 27B81). For example, when Relay Word bit 27B81 \nasserts to logical 1 and blocks the frequency element operation if any voltage \n(VA, VB, or VC) goes below voltage pickup 27B81P. This control prevents \nerroneous frequency element operation following fault inception.\n\nThe SEL-311C frequency measurement algorithm contains logic that \nmonitors line-side PT voltage signals for signs of frequency decay, such as \nline ring-down after a breaker operation. In applications with bus-bar potential \ntransformers, the voltage signals are available even when the circuit breaker is \nopen. Set Loss-of-Potential logic setting EBBPT = Y to ensure proper \nfrequency element operation during open pole conditions.\n\nOther Uses for Undervoltage Element 27B81\nIf voltage pickup setting 27B81P is applicable to other control schemes, Relay \nWord bit 27B81 can be used in other logic at the same time it is used in the \nfrequency element logic.\n\nIf frequency elements are not being used, Relay Word bit 27B81 can still be \nused in other logic, with voltage setting 27B81P set as desired. Enable the \nfrequency elements (setting E81  1) and make setting 27B81P. Apply Relay \nWord bit 27B81 in desired logic scheme, using SELOGIC control equations. \nEven though frequency elements are enabled, the frequency element outputs \n(Relay Word bits 81D1T–81D6T) do not have to be used.\n\nFrequency Element \nUses\n\nThe instantaneous frequency elements (81D1–81D6) are used in testing only.\nThe time-delayed frequency elements (81D1T–81D6T) are used for underfre-\nquency load shedding, frequency restoration, and other schemes.\n\nDelay = 30 s • 60.60 Hz\n= 30 s • 60.60 cycles/s\n= 1818 cycles\n\n\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nSection 4\nR.Instruction Manual\n\nLoss-of-Potential, CCVT Transient \nDetection, Load-Encroachment, and \n\nDirectional Element Logic\n\nOverview\nThis section gives a detailed description of the operation and settings for the \nloss-of-potential logic, load encroachment logic, and directional control logic \nfor overcurrent elements.\n\nThe following functions are discussed in this section:\n\n➤ Loss-of-Potential Logic\n➤ CCVT Transient Detection Logic on page 4.11\n\n➤ Load-Encroachment Logic on page 4.11\n\n➤ Directional Control for Ground Distance and Residual-Ground \nOvercurrent Elements on page 4.17\n\n➤ Directional Control for Phase Distance and \nNegative-Sequence Overcurrent Elements on page 4.26\n\n➤ Directional Control Settings on page 4.29\n\n➤ Overcurrent Directional Control Provided by Torque Control \nSettings on page 4.39\n\nLoss-of-Potential Logic\nThe loss-of-potential (LOP) logic in the SEL-311C relay is used to detect \nblown potential transformer fuses.

During this time, if the loss of a voltage signal is detected, and \nno fault is detected, LOP asserts. \n\nIn normal situations with no fault and no problems with the potential \ntransformers, when the breaker closes, balanced voltages and balanced \ncurrents are expected to appear, and LOP1 stays deasserted for the entire \n20-cycle window.\n\nIf instead the breaker closes with one phase of the PT circuit out of service, \nthe V2/V1 check and the V1 > 10 V check will both assert, and neither of the \nimbalanced current checks I0/I1 nor I2/I1 will assert. After a two cycle \nqualification time, LOP1 will assert.\n\nThe current checks prevent LOP1 from asserting during imbalanced current \nconditions and low current conditions.\n\nTable 4.2 Loss-of-Potential Logic Outputs\n\nRelay \nWord bit\n\nFull Name Description\n\nLOP Loss-of-potential Loss-of-potential status.

As shown in Figure 4.2, the \noperation of LOP4 directly affects the LOP output Relay Word bit, regardless \nof breaker status 3PO.\n\nWhen applying LOP Logic with bus-side PTs, including some unique \nschemes (for example, switching PTs in a Breaker-and-a-Half Scheme), the \nEBBPT = Y setting has some additional advantages.\n\nConsider the breaker-and-a-half scheme in Figure 4.7.\n\nLOP2\nLOP3\n\nRESET HAS\nPRIORITY\n\nLOPRST\n\nLOP\nk-1\n\nLOP1\n\n3PO\n\nSPO\n\n15\nCYC\n\n0\nS\n\nR\n\nQ\n\nRelay\nWord\nBits Relay\n\nWord\nBit\n\nLOPRST\n\nRelay\nWord\n\nBit\nV1 > 0.80 • Vnom\n\nV2/V1\nRatio Check\n\nDV1\n\n(Setting)\n\nV1\n\nV2\n\n10\nCYC\n\n0\n\n\n\n4.9\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nLoss-of-Potential, CCVT Transient Detection, Load-Encroachment, and Directional Element Logic\nLoss-of-Potential Logic\n\nFigure 4.7 Breaker-and-a-Half Scheme with PT Throw-Over Switch\n\nConsider what could happen if we set EBBPT = N for the system in \nFigure 4.7, and a fault occurs on BUS_1, with the relay getting its polarizing \nvoltage from the BUS_1 PT. In this case, LOP does not assert because fault \ncurrent is present. Once BK1 opens, LOP asserts, unless the fault is a \nthree-phase fault. Note that for a three-phase fault, the voltages are already 0, \nso there is no change in voltage. This means that distance elements could \noperate before the PTs are switched if current is above load.\n\nIf EBBPT = Y, LOP asserts when BK1 opens, regardless of fault type, which \neliminates the possibility of an undesired operation during the PT switching.\n\nWith EBBPT = Y, LOP4 asserts and stays asserted when voltages are near \nzero and no change in current is detected. The LOP4 condition is reset when \nvoltages are restored and are healthy for at least 10 cycles (LOPRST).\n\nFigure 4.8 Busbar PT Logic (Relay Word Bit LOP4)\n\nSource Outages when using EBBPT = Y\nIn installations where source outages are expected (perhaps in a radial \nsystem), using setting EBBPT = Y will assert LOP4 (and LOP) during every \nbus outage. When the bus is subsequently energized, LOP4 will remain \nasserted for at least 10 cycles. During this time, distance protection and most \ndirectional elements will be disabled. Depending on the substation bus \nconfiguration and the relay location, it may be possible to implement a scheme \nthat opens the controlled breaker when the station bus is de-energized, and \nthen automatically close the breaker only after LOP deasserts and VPOLV \nasserts, ensuring that directional and distance protection is available.\n\nOtherwise, consider leaving setting EBBPT = N where source outages are likely.\n\nBUS_1\n\nBK1\n\nThrow-Over\nSwitch\n\nRELAY\n\nBUS_2\n\nBK2\n\nUnbalanced\nConditions\n\n(from LOP1 Logic)\n\nLOP4\n\nLOPRST\n\nDI_check\n\nS\n\nR\n\nQ\n\nRelay\nWord Bit\n\nEBBPT = Y\n\n10 V\nV1\n\nSetting\nRelay\n\nWord Bit\n\n\n\n4.10\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nLoss-of-Potential, CCVT Transient Detection, Load-Encroachment, and Directional Element Logic\nLoss-of-Potential Logic\n\nSetting ELOP = Y \nor Y1\n\nIf setting ELOP = Y or Y1 and a loss-of-potential condition occurs (Relay \nWord bit LOP asserts to logical 1), directional element enable Relay Word bits \n32QE, 32QGE, and 32VE, plus the positive-sequence voltage-polarized \ndirectional element and all distance elements are disabled (see Figure 4.13, \nFigure 4.14, Figure 4.21, and Figure 3.2–Figure 3.10). The loss-of-potential \ncondition makes the voltage-polarized directional elements controlled by \nthese internal enables unreliable. The overcurrent elements controlled by these \nvoltage-polarized directional elements are also disabled unless overridden by \nconditions explained in Setting ELOP = Y.\n\nThe channel IN current-polarized directional element (Figure 4.17) is \ncontrolled by internal enable 32IE (Figure 4.14). This directional element is \nnot voltage polarized and thus a loss-of-potential condition does not disable \nthe element.\n\nIn Figure 5.9, if setting ELOP = Y1 and LOP asserts, keying and echo keying \nin the permissive overreaching transfer trip (POTT) logic are blocked.\n\nSetting ELOP = Y Additionally, if setting ELOP = Y and a loss-of-potential condition occurs (Relay Word bit LOP asserts to logical 1), overcurrent elements set direction \nforward are enabled. These direction forward overcurrent elements effectively \nbecome nondirectional and provide overcurrent protection during a \nloss-of-potential condition.\n\nAs detailed previously, voltage-based directional elements are disabled during \na loss-of-potential condition. Thus, the overcurrent elements controlled by \nthese voltage-based directional elements are also disabled. However, this \ndisable condition is overridden for the overcurrent elements set direction \nforward if setting ELOP = Y.\n\nSetting ELOP = N If setting ELOP = N, the loss-of-potential logic still operates (Relay Word bit \nLOP asserts to logical 1 for a loss-of-potential condition) but does not disable \nany voltage-based directional elements (as occurs with ELOP = Y or Y1) or \nenable overcurrent elements set direction forward (as occurs with ELOP = Y).\n\nUsing LOP to \nSupervise \nUndervoltage \nElements\n\nThe LOP logic is intended to supervise distance, directional, and load \nencroachment elements. Exercise caution when using the loss-of-potential \nlogic to supervise undervoltage elements. Under certain low load conditions, \nundervoltage can cause LOP to assert and block undervoltage elements \nunexpectedly. If it is necessary to use Relay Word bit LOP to supervise an \nundervoltage element (27A1, for example) when phase secondary current may \nbe less than 50LP (load detector pickup), consider using logic similar to the \nfollowing:\n\n... + 27A1 * (!LOP + !50LA + !50LB * !50LC) + ....\nwhere 50LP is set at the minimum setting. With this logic, if any phase current \nis below the 50LP setting, when a loss of voltage occurs, Relay Word bit LOP \nmay assert, but one or more of 50LA, 50LB or 50LC will be deasserted and \nthe undervoltage trip will be allowed. Keep in mind that if a true \nloss-of-potential event occurs because of a blown fuse when the current is less \nthan 50LP amps, the undervoltage element will not be blocked. \n\n\n\n4.11\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nLoss-of-Potential, CCVT Transient Detection, Load-Encroachment, and Directional Element Logic\nCCVT Transient Detection Logic\n\nCCVT Transient Detection Logic\nThe SEL-311C detects CCVT transients that may cause Zone 1 distance \noverreach.

However, the \nSEL-311C load encroachment logic does not directly consider the circuit \nbreaker status, and can operate as long as sufficient positive-sequence current \nis available. Thus, ZLOAD, ZLIN, or ZLOUT may still operate during \nsingle-pole open (SPO) conditions, although the meaning may be unclear. \nThis poses no problem for the SEL-311C internal logic, because the only \nplace that ZLOAD is used is in the positive-sequence directional element, \nshown in Figure 4.21. The positive-sequence directional element is already \nblocked by SPO, and the status of the ZLOAD element will have no effect \nduring SPO conditions.\n\nLoad Encroachment \nReporting During SPO\n\nDuring an SPO condition, the standard event report load encroachment digital \nelement column Zld (see Table 12.4) may report element activity that is not \nrepresentative of the power system load flow. This can be safely ignored.\n\nIf any of the ZLOAD, ZLIN, or ZLOUT elements are present in the Sequential \nEvents Recorder (SER) settings, the report may contain several lines of \nunimportant activity during SPO conditions. To improve this situation, the \nRelay Word bit(s) may be supervised by SPO, as shown in this example:\n\nLV10 = ZLIN • !SPO\n\nLV11 = ZLOUT • !SPO\n\nLV10 will assert for incoming load conditions AND NOT[single pole open]\n\nLV11 will assert for outgoing load conditions AND NOT[single pole open]\n\nPlace LV10 and LV11 in the SER settings (SET R) instead of ZLIN and \nZLOUT, to minimize the number of load encroachment-related SER entries \nduring an SPO condition.

In Figure 4.21, notice that the “!ZLOAD” condition is embedded in \nthe positive-sequence voltage-polarized directional element logic. This logic \nprevents the directional element from operating when the measured \npositive-sequence impedance is within the Load In or Load Out regions.\n\nLoad Encroachment for Nondirectional Elements\nIt is possible to use SELOGIC® control equation torque control settings to \napply load encroachment supervision for nondirectional overcurrent elements. \nHowever, keep in mind that load encroachment is not a valid representation of \nthe positive-sequence impedance during unbalanced faults, and ZLOAD may \nassert during certain unbalanced faults. This means that a torque control \nequation intended to prevent operation of a phase overcurrent element for load \nconditions may also prevent operation of the element for unbalanced faults. \nTherefore, when using load encroachment to control phase overcurrent \nelements, residual ground overcurrent elements must be used to detect \nphase-ground faults. Similarly negative-sequence overcurrent elements must \nbe used to detect phase-phase faults (see Appendix G: Setting \nNegative-Sequence Overcurrent Elements). These phase-ground and \nphase-phase elements must be at least as sensitive as the phase overcurrent \nelements.\n\nExample\nIf it is acceptable for the phase overcurrent element to operate for some \nunbalanced fault conditions, refer to Figure 3.32 and make the following \nSELOGIC control equation torque control setting.\n\n51PTC = !ZLOAD * !LOP + 50P4 (= NOT[ZLOAD] * NOT[LOP] + 50P4)\nAs shown in Figure 4.10, load-encroachment logic is a positive-sequence \ncalculation. During LOP conditions (loss-of-potential; see Figure 4.1), \npositive-sequence voltage (V1) can be substantially depressed in magnitude or \nchanged in angle. This change in V1 can possibly cause ZLOAD to deassert \n(= logical 0), erroneously indicating that a “fault condition” exists. Thus, \n!ZLOAD should be supervised by !LOP in a torque control setting. This also \neffectively happens in the directional element in Figure 4.21, where ZLOAD \nand LOP are part of the logic.\n\nIn the above setting example, phase instantaneous overcurrent element 50P4 is \nset above any maximum load current level—if 50P4 picks up, there is \nassuredly a fault. For faults below the pickup level of 50P4, but above the \npickup of phase time-overcurrent element 51PT, the !ZLOAD * !LOP logic \ndiscriminates between high load and fault current. If an LOP condition occurs \n(LOP = logical 1), the pickup level of 50P4 becomes the effective pickup of \nphase time-overcurrent element 51PT. In other words, 51PT loses its \nsensitivity when an LOP condition occurs.\n\n51PTC = !ZLOAD * !LOP + 50P4 = !ZLOAD * NOT[LOP] + 50P4 =  \n!ZLOAD * NOT[logical 1] + 50P4 = 50P4\n\nExample 2\nIf it is not acceptable for the phase-overcurrent element to operate for any \nunbalanced fault current less than 50P4P or for load conditions, enable load \nencroachment (refer to Figure 3.32) and make the following SELOGIC control \nequation torque control setting.\n\n51PTC = M3P * !R32Q + M4P * !F32Q + 50P4\n\n\n\n4.17\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nLoss-of-Potential, CCVT Transient Detection, Load-Encroachment, and Directional Element Logic\nDirectional Control for Ground Distance and Residual-Ground Overcurrent Elements\n\nAlso make the following Group settings.\nDIR3 = R\n\nDIR4 = F\n\nThis uses distance elements M3P (for balanced reverse faults) and M4P (for \nbalanced forward faults) to cause the phase-overcurrent element to be \nsensitive only to three-phase fault conditions. This example also requires \nappropriate Zone 3 and Zone 4 phase reach settings Z3P and Z4P, set with \nenough reach to cover the protected line (or bus) during low-current \nconditions (below the 50P4P overcurrent element setting).\nResidual or neutral ground-overcurrent elements must be used to detect \nphase-ground faults, and negative-sequence overcurrent elements must be \nused to detect phase-to-phase faults (see Appendix G: Setting \nNegative-Sequence Overcurrent Elements). These phase-ground and \nphase-to-phase elements must be at least as sensitive as the phase-overcurrent \nelements.\n\nBecause the directional control logic is defeated when a loss-of-potential \n(LOP) occurs, phase instantaneous overcurrent element 50P4 is set above any \nmaximum load current level—if 50P4 picks up, there is assuredly a fault. If an \nLOP condition occurs (LOP = logical 1), the pickup level of 50P4 becomes \nthe effective pickup of phase time-overcurrent element 51PT. In other words, \n51PT loses its sensitivity when an LOP condition occurs.\n\nSee SEL Application Guide AG2005-07, Guidelines for Applying \nLoad-Encroachment Element for Overcurrent Supervision, available on the \nSEL website, for more information.\n\nUse SEL-321 Relay \nApplication Guide for \nthe SEL-311C Relay\n\nThe load-encroachment logic and settings in the SEL-311C are the same as \nthose in the SEL-321.

The ground distance and residual ground directional overcurrent \nelements will not operate.\n\nIn another example, if setting\nORDER = V\n\nthen the zero-sequence voltage-polarized directional element (V = \nzero-sequence voltage-polarized directional element; see Figure 4.16) \nprovides directional control for the ground distance and residual ground \novercurrent elements at all times (assuming it has sufficient operating \nquantity). If there is not sufficient operating quantity during an event (i.e., \ninternal enable 32VE is not asserted; see Figure 4.14), then no directional \ncontrol is available. The ground distance and residual ground overcurrent \nelements will not operate.\n\nSetting ORDER can be set with any element combination (e.g., ORDER = \nIQV, ORDER = QVI, ORDER = IV, ORDER = VQ, ORDER = I, \nORDER = Q).\nIf ground quadrilateral distance elements are used, the first entry in the \nORDER setting should be as shown in Table 4.8.\n\nTable 4.8 First Entry in ORDER Setting if Ground Quadrilateral Distance \nElements Are Used\n\nSetting XGPOL First Element of ORDER\n\nIG Q or V\nI2 Q\n\n\n\n4.32\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nLoss-of-Potential, CCVT Transient Detection, Load-Encroachment, and Directional Element Logic\nDirectional Control Settings\n\nZ2F—Forward Directional Z2 Threshold\nZ2R—Reverse Directional Z2 Threshold\n\nSetting Range:\n\n–64.00 to 64.00  secondary (5 A nominal phase current inputs, IA, IB, IC)\n–320.00 to 320.00  secondary (1 A nominal phase current inputs, IA, IB, \nIC)\n\nZ2F and Z2R are used to calculate the Forward and Reverse Thresholds, \nrespectively, for the negative-sequence voltage-polarized directional elements \n(see Figure 4.15 and Figure 4.20).\nIf enable setting E32 = Y, settings Z2F and Z2R (negative-sequence \nimpedance values) are calculated and entered by the user, but setting Z2R \nmust be greater in value than setting Z2F by 0.2  secondary (for 5 A nominal \nrelays) or 1  secondary (for 1 A nominal relays).\n\nSetting Guidelines for ORDER and Negative-Sequence Impedance \nDirectional Thresholds\n\nFor most systems, select ORDER = Q. This enables only the 32QGE \nnegative-sequence directional element for ground faults.\n\nIf single contingency (loss-of-line or generator) can cause the loss of the \nnegative-sequence source and no zero-sequence mutual coupling is present, \nset ORDER = QV to use the Best Choice Ground Directional® logic to \nautomatically switch to the zero-sequence voltage-polarized directional \nelement. Avoid selecting an ORDER setting with “V” on lines with \nzero-sequence mutual coupling, because this creates the risk of false \ndeclaration of the 32VE element.\n\nWhen using “I” in the ORDER setting to apply current polarizing (e.g., “QVI” \nor “QI”), analyze system faults to verify that the current polarizing source is \nreliable for all fault types and locations.\n\nIf the relay is applied in a communications-assisted trip scheme (e.g., POTT or \nDCB), use the same ORDER setting at both ends of the line. \nIf the strongest source (smallest Z2 equivalent impedance behind the relay) is \nless than 0.5 ohms secondary, set E32 = AUTO to automatically center the \nZ2F and Z2R threshold settings around one-half of the positive-sequence line \nimpedance based on the line parameter settings, Z1MAG and Z1ANG. The \nline parameter settings, Z1MAG and Z1ANG, must accurately represent the \nsecondary line impedance as seen by the relay.\n\nIf the strongest source is greater than 0.5 ohms secondary, set E32 = Y and set \nZ2F and Z2R thresholds centered around the origin (e. g, Z2F = –0.3, \nZ2R = +0.3). In this case, the negative-sequence directional element still \nrequires a valid setting for Z1ANG.\n\nZ2F and Z2R Set Automatically\nIf enable setting E32 = AUTO, settings Z2F and Z2R (negative-sequence \nimpedance values) are calculated automatically, using the positive-sequence \nline impedance magnitude setting Z1MAG as follows:\n\nZ2F = Z1MAG/2 ( secondary)\nZ2R = Z1MAG/2 + z ( secondary; “z” listed in the following table)\n\nNOTE: If Z2F or Z2R exceeds the \nsetting range, the quantity is set to \nthe upper limit of the setting range.\n\n\n\n4.33\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nLoss-of-Potential, CCVT Transient Detection, Load-Encroachment, and Directional Element Logic\nDirectional Control Settings\n\nFigure 4.23 and Figure 4.24 and supporting text concern the zero-sequence \nimpedance network, relay polarity, and the derivation of settings Z0F and \nZ0R.

Set the \nSEL-311C to trip unconditionally (as with step distance) or with the aid of a \ncommunications channel (as with the POTT, DCUB, DCB, and DTT \nschemes).\n\nThree-Pole Tripping The relay uses three-pole tripping logic if SELOGIC® control equation E3PT (three-pole trip enable) evaluates to logical 1. You can permanently set E3PT \nto logical 1 or assign a control input so that an external condition changes the \nstate of this SELOGIC control equation, or you can assign an internal condition \nto control the state of E3PT.\n\n\n\n5.2\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nTrip Logic\n\nAdditionally, the relay uses three-pole tripping for the following conditions, \nregardless of the E3PT equation.\n\n➤ Tripping initiated by the Switch-Onto-Fault logic\n\n➤ Zone 2 phase distance protection asserts for a phase-to-phase \nor three-phase fault and is permitted to trip via the \ncommunications-assisted tripping logic\n\n➤ Tripping initiated by the manual trip equation BKMTR\n\nThe relay uses three-pole tripping for the following conditions when the E3PT \nequation evaluates to logical 0.\n\n➤ A single-pole trip is in progress and another pole trips (for \nexample, a fault is initially phase B to ground, and evolves to a \nphase A to phase B to ground fault before the B-phase breaker \npole can open and the trip logic can unlatch)\n\n➤ Single-pole tripping conditions are not satisfied (see below)\nThree-pole trip conditions are identified by the 3PT Relay Word bit. \nIndividual phase trip bits TPA, TPB, and TPC will also assert for a three-pole \ntrip condition.\n\nThe TRIP Relay Word bit asserts for any trip condition (single-pole or \nthree-pole).\n\nSingle-Pole Tripping The relay single-pole tripping logic is enabled if SELOGIC control equation \nE3PT evaluates to logical 0.\n\nThe SEL-311C automatically single-pole trips for the following conditions \nwhen the single-pole tripping logic is active.\n\n➤ Zone 1 ground distance protection asserts for a single \nphase-ground fault.\n\n➤ Zone 2 ground distance protection asserts for a single \nphase-ground fault and is permitted to trip via the \ncommunications-assisted tripping logic.\n\n➤ Any one of three SELOGIC control equations, DTA, DTB, or \nDTC, is assigned to an input and asserts (per-phase direct \ntransfer trip).\n\nYou can also set the SEL-311C to single-pole trip through the following three \noptions.\n\nSingle-pole trip conditions are identified by the SPT Relay Word bit, and the \ntripping phase is identified by Relay Word bits TPA, TPB, or TPC.\n\nThe TRIP Relay Word bit asserts for any trip condition (single-pole or \nthree-pole).\n\nTable 5.1 Additional Settings for Single-Pole Tripping (SPT)\n\nSetting Description Selection\n\nZ2GTSP Zone 2 Ground Distance Time Delay Single-Pole Trip Y\n\n67QGSP Zone 2 Directional Negative-Sequence/Residual Ground \nOvercurrent Single-Pole Trip\n\nY\n\nEWFCa\n\na In POTT and DCUB settings.\n\nWeak-Infeed Trip SPb\n\nb SP = Single Pole\n\n\n\n5.3\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nTrip Logic\n\nSetting Z2GTSP = Y\nYou can program the SEL-311C to single-pole trip for Zone 2 ground distance \noperations. With typical distance relay settings, employ the Z2GTSP = Y \nmethod if you want single-pole tripping during ground faults within the last \n20 percent of the protected line when the communications channel is not \navailable. This setting disables one path to the three-phase selection logic \n(3PS) in the first panel of Figure 5.1. \nOnly tripping initiated via the TR and TRQUAL equations are affected by the \nZ2GTSP = Y selection.\n\nSetting 67QGSP = Y\nThe SEL-311C can assert a single-pole trip during high-resistance ground \nfaults so the fault impedance lies outside of the ground distance protection \ncharacteristics; the FIDS logic selects the faulted phase when residual \ndirectional overcurrent elements provide communications-assisted tripping. \nEmploy the 67QGSP = Y method to enable phase selection logic when no \ndistance elements are asserted. This setting enables the APS, BPS, and CPS \nlogic in the first panel of Figure 5.1.\n\nTrip Logic Settings The trip logic in Figure 5.1 provides flexible tripping with SELOGIC control \nequation settings:\n\nTRCOMM Communications-Assisted Trip Conditions—Setting TRCOMM is \nsupervised by communications-assisted trip logic. See \nCommunications-Assisted Trip Logic—General Overview on page 5.23 for \nmore information on communications-assisted tripping.\n\nDTA, DTB, DTC A, B, and C-Phase Direct Transfer Trip Conditions—Note in \nFigure 5.1 that setting DTA, DTB, and DTC are supervised by the pole \nstatus signals SPOA, SPOB, and SPOC. Any element that asserts in \nSELOGIC control equations DTA, DTB, or DTC on a closed breaker phase \nwill cause the DTR Relay Word bit to assert (near the top of the diagram).\nWhen DTR asserts, COMPRM and TRPPRM also assert through the OR \ngate combination, and the corresponding phase trip output TPA, TPB, or \nTPC will assert, provided that breaker pole was not already open (as \nindicated by SPOA, SPOB, or SPOC near the bottom of Figure 5.1).\nSettings DTA, DTB, and DTC are provided separately from setting TR \nand TRQUAL for direct phase tripping and for target LED purposes \n(the default COMM target LED on the front panel illuminates when DTR \nasserts to logical 1; see COMM Target LED on page 5.49).\nSetting DTA, DTB, and DTC are also used for Direct Underreaching \nTransfer Trip (DUTT) schemes.\nIf a three-phase direct transfer trip is desired, place the same element \nin all three equations\n\nDTA = IN106\n\nDTB = IN106\n\nDTC = IN106\n\nwhere input IN106 is connected to the output of direct transfer trip \ncommunications equipment. When IN106 asserts, all three phases will \ntrip (if not already open), and the relay will illuminate the default \nCOMM target LED.\n\nNOTE: Trip logic is also used in the \nrelay to illuminate front-panel trip \ntarget LEDs and generate an \noscillographic event report record.\n\nNOTE: For breaker control \napplications such as open commands \nfrom SCADA systems, use the BKMTR \nequation instead of DTA, DTB, and DTC \n(see below).\n\n\n\n5.4\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nTrip Logic\n\nIf separate phase direct transfer trip is required, program the unique \nconditions into each setting\n\nDTA = RMB3B\n\nDTB = RMB4B\n\nDTC = RMB5B\n\nwhere RMB3B–RMB5B are received MIRRORED BITS elements, \ntransmitted by the relay at the remote end of the transmission line. \nWhen any one of these elements assert and cause DTR to assert, the \nrelay outputs a trip signal to the corresponding breaker pole (if it was \nnot already open), and the relay will illuminate the default COMM target \nLED.\nIf the three-phase trip enable SELOGIC control equation E3PT is \nasserted when DTR asserts, the SEL-311C generates a three-phase trip \n(TPA, TPB, TPC, and 3PT all assert).\n\nTRSOTF Switch-Onto-Fault Trip Conditions—Setting TRSOTF is supervised \nby the switch-onto-fault logic enable SOTFE, and optionally, the \ndisturbance detector when EDDSOTF = Y. A switch-onto-fault trip \n(indicated by Relay Word bit SOTFT) is always a three-pole trip. See \nSwitch-Onto-Fault (SOTF) Trip Logic on page 5.17 for more \ninformation on switch-onto-fault logic.\n\nTR Other Trip Conditions—Setting TR is the SELOGIC control equation trip \nsetting most often used for general protection if tripping does not \ninvolve communications-assisted (settings TRCOMM, DTA, DTB, \nDTC) or switch-onto-fault (setting TRSOTF) trip logic, or \ninstantaneous elements (often used in the TRQUAL equation).\nNote in Figure 5.1 that setting TR is unsupervised. Any element that \nasserts in setting TR will cause Relay Word bit TRIP to assert to logical 1.\nThe TR equation is appropriate for automation and control trips, such \nas breaker open commands, operator control pushbuttons, or \nout-of-step trip conditions. These conditions may be present for only \none processing interval, but the SEL-311C issues a TRIP immediately \nupon evaluating the TR equation to logical 1.\n\nTRQUAL Qualified Trip Conditions—The SEL-311C has self-test functions \nto detect most hardware problems and prevent misoperation. A small \nnumber of transient memory or processor errors may not be detected. \nThe TRQUAL equation and EDDSOTF Switch-Onto-Fault \nsupervision improve security for these transient conditions without \nincreasing relay operating time under most fault conditions. Setting \nTRQUAL is supervised by the disturbance detector logic, as shown in \nFigure 5.1. The disturbance detector (DD) logic detail is shown in \nFigure 4.2. \nWhen the SEL-311C evaluates the TRQUAL equation to logical 1, the \nrelay trips immediately if the DD Relay Word bit is already asserted. If \nDD is not asserted, the relay waits as long as two cycles for DD to \nassert. If the TRQUAL equation remains asserted the relay trips after \nthe timer expires.\nThe disturbance detector is very sensitive to fault conditions, and will \nalmost always assert before a Zone 1 element asserts for a new fault \ncondition. The DD element also contains a 10-cycle dropout timer to \nmaintain a logical 1 for a reasonable period after a disturbance is \ndetected. Using the TRQUAL equation for Zone 1 elements or \ninstantaneous overcurrent elements will almost never increase \noperating time.\n\nNOTE: When a trip is required on all \nthree phases for line clearances, use \nthe BKMTR equation instead of DTA, \nDTB, and DTC (see below).\n\n\n\n5.5\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nTrip Logic\n\nSecurity is improved when the TRQUAL equation is asserted \nmomentarily because of a transient memory or processor error, but the \ndisturbance detector does not assert. If the TRQUAL equation resets \nbefore the two-cycle timer expires, no TRIP is issued.\nUse the TRQUAL setting with instantaneous elements, such as in the \nfollowing setting.\n\nTRQUAL = M1P + Z1G\n\nOvercurrent or distance elements that contain an intentional time delay \nmay be used in the TRQUAL equation. In certain conditions, such as \nduring bench testing with delays set longer than 10 cycles, the \ndisturbance detector element may deassert before the time-delayed \nelement asserts in the TRQUAL equation. This adds two cycles to the \noverall trip time. \nFor example, if setting TRQUAL contains a negative-sequence \ntime-overcurrent element,\n\nTRQUAL = … + 51QT\n\nthe observed trip time may be as long as two cycles longer than the expected \ntime-overcurrent characteristic. For backup protection delays lasting several \nseconds, this extra time is of no consequence. If this extra delay is not \ndesirable, use the time-delayed elements in the TR equation instead.\nElements that assert for nonfault conditions, such as breaker open \ncommands, operator control pushbuttons, or out-of-step trip \nconditions, should not be used in the TRQUAL equation. The reason is \nthat the asserted condition may only exist for one processing interval, \nand the DD bit will often be quiescent. This situation will sometimes \nresult in a nontrip. Use the unsupervised TR setting for automation or \ncontrol tripping instead.\nSetting EDDSOTF = Y enables similar supervision for the \nswitch-onto-fault logic.\n\nBKMTR Breaker Manual Trip Conditions—Setting BKMTR provides \nunconditional trip capability, suitable for manual trip conditions. A \nmanual trip (indicated by Relay Word bit BKMTR) is always a \nthree-pole trip. When BKMTR initiates a trip, only the factory-default \nTRIP target LED illuminates.\nThe BKMTR equation differs from the TR equation by the direct \nconnection from BKMTR to the 3PS (3-Phases Selected) OR-gate in \nFigure 5.1 and that the internal target logic does not consider any \ntarget condition when BKMTR causes the trip.\n\nMore than one trip setting (or all six trip settings TRCOMM, DTT, TRSOTF, \nTR, TRQUAL, and BKMTR) can be set. For example, in a \ncommunications-assisted trip scheme, TRCOMM is set with direction forward \noverreaching Level 2 distance elements, TRQUAL is set with direction \nforward underreaching Level 1 distance elements and other time-delayed \nelements (e.g., Zone 2 definite-time distance elements), and TRSOTF is set \nwith instantaneous directional and nondirectional elements.\n\nTrip Unlatch Options Unlatch the trip contact output after the trip to remove dc voltage from the trip \ncoil. The SEL-311C provides two settings to unlatch trip contact outputs after \na protection trip has occurred:\n\n➤ TULO—following a protection trip, phase selective\n\n➤ ULTR—following a protection trip, all three poles\n\nThese settings are discussed further in Unlatch Trip on page 5.12.\n\n\n\n5.6\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nTrip Logic\n\nTULO\nTable 5.2 shows the four trip unlatch options for setting TULO.\n\nULTR\nUse ULTR, the unlatch trip SELOGIC control equation, to define the \nconditions that unlatch the trip contact outputs. This method always unlatches \nall three poles.\n\nTimers The SEL-311C provides dedicated timers for the trip logic.\nMinimum Trip Duration\n\nThe minimum trip duration timer settings, TDUR1D and TDUR3D, determine \nthe minimum length of time that Relay Word bits TPA, TPB, TPC, and 3PT \nassert. Use these timers for the designated trip control outputs. The three \ntimers that use the TDUR1D and TRUR3D settings are shown in the second \nsheet of Figure 5.1. The trip output occurs for the TDURD time or the \nduration of the trip condition, whichever is greater.\n\n➤ TDUR1D is the minimum trip duration time following a \nsingle-pole trip.\n\n➤ TDUR3D is the minimum trip duration time following a \nthree-pole trip. If another trip occurs while a single-pole trip is \noccurring, TDUR3D replaces TDUR1D.\n\nTrip During Open-Pole Time Delay\nIf another fault occurs, it is common to trip the two remaining phases for the \nfollowing periods.\n\n➤ During the interval where the breaker is in the process of \nopening (single pole) or has just opened but the trip unlatch \nlogic has not yet deasserted.\n\n➤ During the single-pole open interval following the original \nsingle-pole trip.\n\n➤ During the reclosing relay reset state following a reclose.\n\nCoverage for the first situation is built into the trip logic in Figure 5.1 and \nworks with the factory-default trip output contact assignments that include \nsingle-pole and three-pole terms.\n\nUse the TOP (Trip During Open Pole) Relay Word bit to select a three-pole \ntrip after a single-pole trip in the SEL-311C. Set TOPD (Trip During \nOpen-Pole Time Delay) and include the TOP Relay Word bit in the E3PT \nsetting. The Trip during Open-Pole logic is shown in Figure 5.3.\n\nTable 5.2 Setting TULO Unlatch Trip Option\n\nOption Description\n\n1 Unlatch the trip when the load detector element(s) 50LA, 50LB, or 50LC \nindicate that the corresponding breaker pole is open. During three pole trip \n(3PT) operations the TULO = 1 option waits for all three poles to open.a\n\na The load detector element pickup levels are controlled by group setting 50LP. These elements \nare also used in Pole-Open Logic on page 5.18.\n\n2 Unlatch the trip when the relay detects that the 52A contact(s) from the \ncircuit breaker (e.g., 52AA) are deasserted.\n\n3 Unlatch the trip when the relay detects that the conditions for both Option 1 \nand Option 2 are satisfied.\n\n4 Do not run this logic.\n\n\n\n5.7\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nTrip Logic\n\nTimer setting TOPD (Trip During Open-Pole Time Delay) determines the \nperiod during which any subsequent trips are converted to a three-pole trip \nfollowing the a single-pole trip. The TOP Relay Word bit may also be used in \nother SELOGIC equations, such as the Reclosing Relay drive-to-lockout \nsetting (79DTL).\nTo use the reclosing relay in the SEL-311C, see Reclosing Application for \nMixed Single-Pole and Three-Pole Tripping Scheme on page 6.31. This \nsection describes the settings necessary for auto-reclose logic control of the \nsingle-pole and three-pole tripping sequence. The TOPD (Trip During \nOpen-Pole Time Delay) timer is used in this example.\nIf an external reclosing relay is used, control signals from the reclosing relay \nmay be used to control the SEL-311C single- and three-pole tripping \nsequence. \n\nTrip Logic Diagram \nand Relay Word Bits\n\nThe SEL-311C trip logic is shown in Figure 5.1 (this diagram spans two \npages), Figure 5.2, and Figure 5.3.

Relay Word bits SPT and TRIP will \nalso assert. With the factory-default settings, relay output contacts OUT101, \nOUT102, and OUT103 are to be wired to the single-pole trip dc circuitry. \n\nFor three-pole trips, the relay asserts all three phase trip signals ATPA, ATPB, and \nATPC. The three-pole trip duration time delay setting TDUR3D is loaded into all \nthree of the phase trip duration timers, and the relay asserts the three final trip \noutputs TPA, TPB, and TPC. Relay Word bits 3PT and TRIP also assert.\n\nAs shown in the time line example in Figure 5.4, the Minimum Trip Duration \nTimer (with setting TDUR1D for single pole trips, and TDUR3D for 3-pole \ntrips) outputs a logical 1 for a time duration of “TDUR_D” cycles any time it \nsees a rising edge on its input (logical 0 to logical 1 transition), if it is not \nalready timing (timer is reset). Using the A-phase trip logic as an example, the \nTDUR_D timer assures that the TPA Relay Word bit remains asserted at \nlogical 1 for a minimum of “TDUR_D” cycles. If the output of ATPA gate is \nlogical 1 beyond the TDUR_D time, Relay Word bit TPA remains asserted at \nlogical 1 for as long as the output of TPA gate remains at logical 1, regardless \nof other trip logic conditions.\n\nThe Minimum Trip Duration Timer settings can be set no less than 2 cycles.\n\nFigure 5.4 Minimum Trip Duration Timer Operation A-Phase Example (see \nsecond panel of Figure 5.1)\n\nUnlatch Trip Once the SEL-311C asserts a trip Relay Word bit (TPA, TPB, or TPC), the bit \nremains asserted until all of the following conditions come true.\n\n➤ Minimum Trip Duration Timer stops timing (logic output of \nthe TDUR_D timer goes to logical 0)\n\n➤ Output of the driving trip condition (ATPA, ATPB, or ATPC) \ndeasserts to logical 0\n\n➤ One of the following occurs.\n➣ SELOGIC control equation setting ULTR asserts to logical 1\n➣ The per-phase unlatch trip logic ULTRA, ULTRB, or \n\nULTRC asserts to logical 1\n\nExample output of \nTPA (input into \n\nMinimum Trip \nDuration Timer)\n\nResultant logic \noutput of Minimum \nTrip Duration Timer\n\nOR-combination of \nabove two logic traces \n\n(Relay Word bit TPA)\n\nRising-edge \ninput occurring \nwhen the \nMinimum\nTrip Duration\nTimer is reset\n\nTD\nUR\n\nD\n\nTD\nUR\n\nD\n\nTD\nUR\n\nD\n\n\n\n5.13\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nTrip Logic\n\n➣ The front-panel TARGET RESET pushbutton is pressed\n➣ The TAR R (Target Reset) command is executed via the \n\nserial port\n➣ A Target Reset command is received from a DNP or \n\nModbus® master\n\nPer-Phase Unlatch Trip Logic\nThe SEL-311C features built-in logic to create unlatch trip Relay Word bits \nULTRA, ULTRB, and ULTRC for single-pole tripping applications. See Trip \nUnlatch Options on page 5.5 for details on the TULO setting and Figure 5.2 \nfor the ULTRA, ULTRB, and ULTRC logic diagram.\n\nThe per-phase unlatch trip logic is shown in the second panel of Figure 5.1.\n\nSeparate phase unlatch logic is beneficial for single-pole tripping. The TULO \nsetting allows the relay to create unlatch signals based on load detectors \n(50LA, 50LB, 50LC), breaker status signals (52AA, 52AB, 52AC), or both. \nWithout special unlatch trip logic, attempting to set the ULTR SELOGIC \ncontrol equation would be difficult. For example, a typical setting for \nthree-pole tripping relays is shown below.\n\nULTR = !(50L + 51G)\n\nThe difficulty is that during single-pole open conditions, the 50L element \n(which is the logical OR of 50LA, 50LB, 50LC) will not deassert because two \nphases are still supplying load, while the 51G element may assert because of \nthe imbalance caused by a single-pole open condition.\n\nA better solution is to set ULTR = 0 (logical 0), and set TULO = 1, 2, or 3 \ndepending on your substation design and company practices.\n\nTarget Reset Logic\nThe front-panel TARGET RESET pushbutton, the TAR R (Target Reset) serial port \ncommand, and the DNP or Modbus target reset commands are used to force the \nasserted trip Relay Word bit (TPA, TPB, or TPC) to logical 0 if setting ULTR or \nRelay Word bits ULTRA, ULTRB, or ULTRC do not assert to unlatch the trip. This \nmight occur during testing or when ULTR has been set to logical 0 or TULO is set to \n4 (which defeats the ULTRA, ULTRB, and ULTRC logic). \nSetting ULTR = 0 and TULO = 4 allows a trip condition to stay asserted until \nthe targets are reset by the front-panel TARGET RESET pushbutton, the TAR R \ncommand, or the DNP or Modbus target reset. This allows the relay to provide \na lockout function.\n\nSELOGIC control equation RSTTRGT (see SELOGIC Control Equation Setting \nRSTTRGT on page 5.57) does not unlatch TRIP. See Optional Logic to Clear \nTrip Seal-In and Reset Targets on page 5.57 for more information.\n\nTarget Reset Logic Output\nThe front-panel TARGET RESET pushbutton, the TAR R (Target Reset) serial \nport command, and the DNP or Modbus target reset commands are combined \ninto Relay Word bit TRGTR as shown in the second panel of Figure 5.1. See \nOther Applications for the Other Applications for the Target Reset Function \non page 5.56 for application ideas for this Relay Word bit.\n\n\n\n5.14\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nTrip Logic\n\nFactory Settings \nExample (Using \nSettings TR, TRQUAL, \nand BKMTR)\n\nIn this example the “communications-assisted” and “switch-onto-fault” trip logic in \nthe first panel of Figure 5.1 are not used. The SELOGIC control equation trip settings \nTR, TRQUAL, and BKMTR are the only inputs that need to be discussed. These \ninputs feed into the trip permission TRPRM Relay Word bit.\n\nThe factory settings for the trip logic SELOGIC control equation settings are \nlisted below.\n\nTR = M2PT + Z2GT + 51GT + 51QT (time-delayed trip conditions)\nTRQUAL = M1P + Z1G (instantaneous trip conditions)\nE3PT = 1 (enable three-pole trip)\nBKMTR = OC (manual trip conditions)\nULTR = !(50L + 51G) (unlatch trip conditions)\n\nThe factory settings for the Minimum Trip Duration Timers are listed below.\nTDUR1D = 9.00 cycles (single-pole duration—not used when E3PT = 1)\nTDUR3D = 9.00 cycles (three-pole duration)\n\nThe factory setting for the Trip During Open-Pole Delay is listed below.\nTOPD = 2.00 cycles\n\nThe factory setting for the Trip Unlatch Option is listed below.\nTULO = 3 (both methods enabled)\n\nSee the SEL-311C Settings Sheets in Section 9: Setting the Relay for setting ranges.\n\nSet Trip \nIn SELOGIC control equation setting TR = M2PT + Z2GT + 51GT + 51QT\n\nDistance elements M2PT and Z2GT, and time-overcurrent elements \n51GT and 51QT trip directly. Time-overcurrent and definite-time \novercurrent elements can be torque controlled (e.g., elements 51GT and \n51QT are torque-controlled by SELOGIC control equation settings 51GTC \nand 51QTC, respectively). Check torque control settings to see if any \ncontrol is applied to time-overcurrent and definite-time-overcurrent \nelements. Such control is not apparent by mere inspection of trip setting \nTR or any other SELOGIC control equation trip setting.\n\nIn SELOGIC control equation setting TRQUAL = M1P + Z1G\n\nDistance elements M1P and Z1G trip directly, subject to supervision by \nthe Disturbance Detector Relay Word bit (DD) as described in Trip Logic \nSettings on page 5.3.\n\nIn SELOGIC control equation setting E3PT = 1\n\nThe three-pole trip mode is permanently selected. For every trip \ncondition, the relay will assert the TPA, TPB, TPC, 3PT, and TRIP Relay \nWord bits.\n\nIn SELOGIC control equation setting BKMTR = OC\n\nRelay Word bit OC asserts for execution of the OPEN Command. This \nmanual trip equation always causes a three-pole trip, regardless of the \nstate of equation E3PT. See OPE Command (Open Breaker) on \npage 10.57 for more information on the OPEN Command.\n\nWith setting TDUR3D = 9.00 cycles, once the TPA, TPB, TPC, 3PT, and \nTRIP Relay Word bits assert via the trip logic, they remain asserted at \nlogical 1 for a minimum of 9 cycles.\n\nNOTE: Do not use Relay Word bits \nthat assert momentarily in the \nTRQUAL equation. For example, the \nopen breaker command Relay Word \nbit OC or optional operator control \npushbuttons (e.g., PB10PUL) only \nassert for one processing interval and \nmay not cause a trip using the \nTRQUAL equation in some situations. \nUse these types of Relay Word bits in \nthe TR or BKMTR equation instead.\n\nNOTE: In the factory settings, \nbecause E3PT = 1, the relay always \ntrips three-pole, and the single-pole \nminimum trip duration setting TDUR1D \nis not used.\n\n\n\n5.15\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nTrip Logic\n\nUnlatch Trip\nIn SELOGIC control equation setting ULTR =!(50L + 51G)\n\nBoth elements must be deasserted before the trip logic unlatches and the \nTPA, TPB, TPC, 3PT, and TRIP Relay Word bits deassert to logical 0.\n\nAdditional Settings \nExamples\n\nThe factory setting for SELOGIC control equation setting ULTR is a \ncurrent-based trip unlatch condition, suitable for three-pole tripping. The \nbuilt-in unlatch logic, enabled by the TULO setting, should be used for \nsingle-pole tripping applications. \n\nSingle-Pole Unlatch Trip With 52a Circuit Breaker Auxiliary Contacts\nThe factory settings require the A-phase 52a circuit breaker auxiliary contact \nto be wired to optoisolated input IN101, the B-phase wired to IN102, and \nC-phase wired to IN103. See Optoisolated Inputs on page 7.1 for contact \ndebounce timer settings details on IN101–IN103. See Section 2: Installation \nfor wiring details. For single-pole trip applications, the trip unlatch option can \nbe configured to operate from the 52AA, 52AB, and 52AC Relay Word bits.\n\nLogic Settings\n\n52A = 52AA * 52AB * 52AC (Derived breaker status.

The single-phase unlatch trip logic is shown in \nFigure 5.2.\n\nSingle-Pole Unlatch Trip With 52b Circuit Breaker Auxiliary Contacts\nThe factory settings require the A-phase 52b circuit breaker auxiliary contact \nto be wired to optoisolated input IN101, the B-phase wired to IN102, and \nC-phase wired to IN103.\n\nLogic settings\n\n52A = 52AA * 52AB * 52AC (Derived breaker status.

See Unlatch \nTrip on page 5.12 for details. \n\n\n\n5.16\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nTrip Logic\n\nSingle-Pole Unlatch Trip With Load Detectors\nThe SEL-311C load detector pickup setting, 50LP, creates separate \novercurrent elements 50LA, 50L, and 50LC, as explained in Pole-Open Logic \non page 5.18. For single-pole trip applications, the trip unlatch option can be \nconfigured to operate from these load detector Relay Word bits.\n\nLogic settings\n\nULTR = 0 (not used)\nGroup settings\n\n50LP = 0.25 A secondary (minimum setting value)\nTULO = 1 (Select unlatching from load detectors. See Table 5.2)\n\nThese example settings will generate unlatch trip Relay Word bits ULTRA, \nULTRB, and ULTRC for each trip output (TPA, TPB, and TPC) based on the \nload detector signal(s) deasserting when the open-phase current falls below \nthe 50LP setting threshold. For three-pole trips (3PT = logical 1), the relay \nwaits until all three load detectors have deasserted before asserting the unlatch \nbits. The single-phase unlatch trip logic is shown in Figure 5.2.\n\nSingle-Pole Unlatch Trip With Load Detectors and 52a Circuit Breaker \nAuxiliary Contacts\n\nThis method uses both the breaker auxiliary contact status and the load \ndetector status from the previous two examples. \n\nLogic settings\n\n52A = 52AA * 52AB * 52AC (Derived breaker status. Do not use for external \nindication that equipment is de-energized.)\n\n52AA = IN101 (SELOGIC control equation A-phase circuit breaker status)\n52AB = IN102\n\n52AC = IN103\n\nULTR = 0 (not used)\nGroup settings\n\n50LP = 0.25 A secondary (minimum setting value)\nTULO = 3 (Select unlatching from 52A status bits and load detectors. See \n\nTable 5.2.)\nThese example settings will generate unlatch trip Relay Word bits ULTRA, \nULTRB, and ULTRC for each trip output (TPA, TPB, and TPC) based on the \nload detector signal(s) deasserting AND the same phase breaker status signal \ndeasserting. The single-phase unlatch trip logic is shown in Figure 5.2.\n\nProgram Output \nContacts for Tripping\n\nIn the factory settings, the result of the trip logic in Figure 5.1 is routed to \noutput contacts OUT101, OUT102, and OUT103 with the following SELOGIC \ncontrol equation settings:\n\nOUT101 = 3PT + TPA\n\nOUT102 = 3PT + TPB\n\nOUT103 = 3PT + TPC\n\nThese settings are appropriate for both single-pole tripping and three-pole \ntripping. If an additional three-pole only trip output is required, program the \nadditional output using only 3PT. \n\n\n\n5.17\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nSwitch-Onto-Fault (SOTF) Trip Logic\n\nIf more than one set of trip output contacts are needed, program other output \ncontacts with the same set of equations. Below are examples of uses for \nadditional TRIP output contacts:\n\n➤ Tripping more than one breaker\n\n➤ Keying an external breaker failure relay\n\n➤ Keying communication equipment in a Direct Transfer Trip \nscheme\n\nSee Output Contacts on page 7.33 for more information on programming \noutput contacts.\n\nTRIP Results Used in \nOther Settings\n\nBesides operating a trip output contact (e.g., OUT101 = 3PT + TPA), the \nvarious trip output Relay Word bits are used in some other factory-default \nSELOGIC control equation settings.\n\nULCL = TRIP unlatch close (see Figure 6.1)\nBKMONA = TPA + 3PT A-phase breaker monitor initiation (see Breaker \n\nMonitor on page 8.1)\nBKMONB = TPB + 3PT B-phase breaker monitor initiation\nBKMONC = TPC + 3PT C-phase breaker monitor initiation\n\nSwitch-Onto-Fault (SOTF) Trip Logic\nThe disturbance detector is very sensitive to fault conditions, and will almost \nalways assert before a high-set overcurrent element asserts for a new fault \ncondition. The DD element also contains a 10-cycle dropout timer to maintain \na logical 1 for a reasonable period after a disturbance is detected. Using the \nEDDSOTF= Y setting while using instantaneous overcurrent elements or \ndistance elements in the SOTF equation will almost never increase operating \ntime.\n\nSwitch-Onto-Fault (SOTF) trip logic provides a programmable time window \nfor selected elements to trip right after the circuit breaker closes. \n“Switch-onto-fault” implies that a circuit breaker is closed into an existing \nfault condition, such as when safety grounds are accidentally left attached to a \nline. If the circuit breaker is closed into such a condition, the resulting fault \nneeds to be cleared right away and reclosing blocked. An instantaneous \nelement is usually set to trip in the SOTF trip logic.\n\nFor added security, the SEL-311C features a selectable disturbance detector \nsupervision function on the switch-onto-fault trip condition. Enable this logic \nby setting EDDSOTF = Y. The operation is described below.\n\nRefer to the switch-onto-fault trip logic in Figure 5.1 (middle of first panel). \nThe SOTF trip logic permits tripping if both the following occur.\n\n➤ An element asserts in SELOGIC control equation trip setting \nTRSOTF\n\n➤ Relay Word bit SOTFE is asserted to logical 1\n\nThe SEL-311C asserts Relay Word bit SOTFT to indicate that a \nswitch-onto-fault trip has been initiated. \n\n\n\n5.18\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nSwitch-Onto-Fault (SOTF) Trip Logic\n\nRelay Word bit SOTFE (the output of the SOTF logic) provides the effective \ntime window for an element in trip setting TRSOTF (e.g., TRSOTF = 50P2) to \ntrip after the circuit breaker closes.

Time setting 52AEND qualifies the \nthree-pole open (3PO) condition and then asserts Relay Word bit SOTFE.\n\nSOTFE = logical 1\n\nNote that SOTFE is asserted when the circuit breaker is open. This allows \nelements set in the SELOGIC control equation trip setting TRSOTF to operate \nif a fault occurs when the circuit breaker is open (see Figure 5.1). In such a \nscenario (e.g., flashover inside the circuit breaker tank), the tripping via \nsetting TRSOTF cannot help in tripping the circuit breaker (the circuit breaker \nis already open), but can initiate breaker failure protection, if a breaker failure \nscheme is implemented in the SEL-311C or externally.\n\nWhen the circuit breaker is closed, the 3PO condition deasserts (3PO = \nlogical 0) after the 3POD dropout time (setting 3POD is usually set for no \nmore than a cycle). The SOTF logic output, SOTFE, continues to remain \nasserted at logical 1 for dropout time SOTFD time.\n\nClose Bus Operated \nSwitch-Onto-Fault \nLogic\n\nClose bus operated switch-onto-fault logic is enabled by making time setting \nCLOEND (CLOEND  OFF). Time setting CLOEND qualifies the \ndeassertion of the load detection element 50L (indicating that the circuit \nbreaker is open).\nCircuit breaker closure is detected by monitoring the dc close bus. This is \naccomplished by wiring an optoisolated input on the SEL-311C (e.g., IN105) \nto the dc close bus. When a manual close or automatic reclosure occurs, \noptoisolated input IN105 is energized. SELOGIC control equation setting \nCLMON (close bus monitor) monitors the optoisolated input IN105.\n\nCLMON = IN105 * 3PO\n\nStarting from a three-pole open condition (3PO = logical 1), when \noptoisolated input IN105 is energized, CLMON asserts to logical 1. At the \ninstant that optoisolated input IN105 is energized (close bus is energized), the \ncircuit breaker is still open so the output of the CLOEND timer continues to \nbe asserted to logical 1. Thus, the ANDed combination of these conditions \nlatches in the SOTFD timer. The SOTFD timer outputs a logical 1 for a time \nduration of “SOTFD” cycles any time it sees a rising edge on its input (logical \n0 to logical 1 transition), if it is not already timing. The SOTF logic output, \nSOTFE, asserts to logical 1 for SOTFD time.\n\n\n\n5.22\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nSwitch-Onto-Fault (SOTF) Trip Logic\n\nStarting from a single-pole open condition (SPO = logical 1, 3PO = logical 0), \nwhen optoisolated input IN105 is energized, CLMON is prevented from \nasserting and remains at logical 0. This prevents a Switch-Onto-Fault Enable \ncondition (SOFTE) from being initiated if the line was lightly-loaded (i.e., \n50L is not asserted, but 3PO is not asserted).\n\nSwitch-Onto-Fault \nLogic Output (SOTFE)\n\nRelay Word bit SOTFE is the output of the circuit breaker operated SOTF \nlogic or the close bus operated SOTF logic described previously. Time setting \nSOTFD in each of these logic paths provides the effective time window for the \ninstantaneous elements in SELOGIC control equation trip setting TRSOTF to \ntrip after the circuit breaker closes (see Figure 5.1, middle of first panel). Time \nsetting SOTFD is usually set around 30 cycles.\n\nRelay Word bit SOTFT asserts when a switch-onto-fault trip has been \ngenerated. SOTFT may be helpful for programmable target logic, testing, and \nreporting functions.\n\nA SOTF trip illuminates the SOTF default front-panel LED.\n\nDisturbance Detector \nSupervision for \nSwitch-Onto-Fault \nLogic\n\nThe SEL-311C features a selectable disturbance detector supervision function \non the switch-onto-fault trip condition. Enable this logic by setting \nEDDSOTF = Y, which is the factory-default selection.\n\nRefer to Figure 5.1 for the EDDSOTF influence on the SOTF logic.\n\nWhen EDDSOTF = N, the switch-onto-fault logic works with no DD \nsupervision, and the relay immediately asserts SOTFT and issues a TRIP \nwhen TRSOTF evaluates to logical 1 with SOTFE asserted.\n\nWhen EDDSOTF = Y, the relay checks the state of the Disturbance Detector \n(DD) Relay Word bit when TRSOTF evaluates to logical 1 with SOTFE \nasserted.\n\n➤ If DD is asserted, the relay immediately asserts the SOTFT \noutput, which causes an immediate trip.\n\n➤ If DD is not asserted, and the TRSOTF and SOTFE conditions \nremain asserted, the relay delays the SOTFT assertion for as \nmany as 2 cycles (until the DD element asserts, or until the \n2-cycle wait time expires). \n\n➤ If one of the TRSOTF or SOTFE conditions deassert before the \n2-cycle timer expires, and the DD bit does not assert, no trip is \nissued. This provides a security improvement in cases where an \nelement in the TRSOTF equation was transient.\n\nThe relay also uses the disturbance detector in the TRQUAL equation, as \ndescribed in TRQUAL Qualified Trip Conditions on page 5.4.\nThe disturbance detector is very sensitive to fault conditions, and will almost \nalways be asserted before a high-set overcurrent element asserts for a new \nfault condition. The DD element also contains a 10-cycle dropout timer to \nmaintain a logical 1 for a reasonable period after a disturbance is detected. In \nother words, using the EDDSOTF= Y setting while using instantaneous \novercurrent elements or distance elements in the SOTF equation will almost \nnever impair protection speed.\n\nUse the TRSOTF setting with instantaneous elements, such as in the \nfactory-default setting.\n\nTRSOTF = M2P+Z2G+50P1\n\n\n\n5.23\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nCommunications-Assisted Trip Logic—General Overview\n\nSwitch-Onto-Fault \nTrip Logic Trip Setting \n(TRSOTF)\n\nAn instantaneous element is usually set to trip in the SELOGIC control \nequation trip setting TRSOTF (e.g., TRSOTF = M2P + Z2G + 50P1).\nIf the voltage potential for the relay is from the line-side of the circuit breaker, \nthe instantaneous overcurrent element in the SELOGIC control equation trip \nsetting TRSOTF should be nondirectional. When the circuit breaker is open \nand the line is de-energized, the relay sees zero voltage. If a close-in \nthree-phase fault condition exists on the line (e.g., safety grounds accidentally \nleft attached to the line after a clearance) and then the circuit breaker is closed, \nthe relay continues to see zero voltage. The directional elements have no \nvoltage for reference and cannot operate.\n\nCommunications-Assisted Trip Logic—General \nOverview\n\nThe SEL-311C includes communications-assisted tripping schemes that \nprovide unit-protection for transmission lines with the help of \ncommunications. No external coordination devices are required.\n\nFigure 5.7 Communications-Assisted Tripping Scheme\n\nRefer to Figure 5.7 and the left panel of Figure 5.1.\n\nThe six available tripping schemes are:\n\n➤ Direct Transfer Trip (DTT)\n➤ Direct Underreaching Transfer Trip (DUTT)\n➤ Permissive Overreaching Transfer Trip (POTT)\n➤ Directional Comparison Unblocking (DCUB)\n➤ Directional Comparison Blocking (DCB)\n\nZone 3 (1)\nZone 1 (1)\n\nZone 2 (1)\n\nZone 1 (2)\nZone 3 (2)\n\nZone 2 (2)\n\nSEL-311CSEL-311C\n\nBu\ns \n\n1 Bus 2\n\nComm.\nEquip\n\nComm.\nEquip\n\nTX TX\n\nRX RX\n\nTransmission Line52\n1\n\n52\n2\n\n\n\n5.24\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nCommunications-Assisted Trip Logic—General Overview\n\nEnable Setting \nECOMM\n\nThe POTT, PUTT, DCUB, and DCB tripping schemes are enabled with setting \nECOMM. Setting choices include the following.\n\nECOMM = N [no communications-assisted trip scheme enabled]\nECOMM = POTT [POTT or PUTT scheme]\nECOMM = DCUB1 [DCUB scheme for two-terminal line (communications \n\nfrom one remote terminal)]\nECOMM = DCUB2 [DCUB scheme for three-terminal line (communications \n\nfrom two remote terminals)]\nECOMM = DCB [DCB scheme]\n\nThese tripping schemes can all work in two-terminal or three-terminal line \napplications. The DCUB scheme requires separate settings choices for these \napplications (ECOMM = DCUB1 or DCUB2) because of unique DCUB logic \nconsiderations.\n\nThese tripping schemes require Zone/Level 3 elements set direction reverse \n(setting DIR3 = R). Note that Zone 1 and Zone 2 are fixed in the forward \ndirection.\n\nSee Directional Control Settings on page 4.29 for more information on \nZone/Level direction settings DIR3 and DIR4.\n\nPOTT, PUTT, DCUB, and DCB communications-assisted tripping schemes \nare explained in subsections that follow.\n\nTrip Setting TRCOMM The POTT, PUTT, DCUB, and DCB tripping schemes use SELOGIC control \nequation trip setting TRCOMM for those tripping elements that are supervised \nby the communications-assisted trip logic (see left panel of Figure 5.1). \nSetting TRCOMM is typically set with Level 2 overreaching distance \nelements (fixed direction forward).\n\nM2P Zone 2 phase distance instantaneous element\n\nZ2G Zone 2 ground distance instantaneous element\n\nThe exception is a DCB scheme (see Figure 5.17), where Zone 2 overreaching \ndistance elements (set direction forward) with a short delay are used instead. \nThe short delays provide necessary carrier coordination delays (waiting for the \nblock trip signal). These elements are entered in trip setting TRCOMM.\n\nTrip Settings TRSOTF, \nTRQUAL, and TR\n\nIn a communications-assisted trip scheme, the SELOGIC control equation trip \nsettings TRSOTF, TRQUAL, and TR can also be used, in addition to setting \nTRCOMM.\n\nSetting TRSOTF can be set as described in Switch-Onto-Fault (SOTF) Trip \nLogic on page 5.17.\n\nSetting TRQUAL is typically set with unsupervised Level 1 underreaching \nelements (fixed direction forward).\n\nM1P Zone 1 phase distance instantaneous element\n\nZ1G Zone 1 ground distance instantaneous element \n67G1 Level 1 directional residual ground instantaneous overcurrent element\n\n67Q1 Level 1 directional negative-sequence instantaneous overcurrent \nelement\n\n\n\n5.25\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nCommunications-Assisted Trip Logic—General Overview\n\nThe SEL-311C allows instantaneous tripping for elements in the TRQUAL \nequation when Relay Word bit DD is asserted. If an element in the TRQUAL \nsetting asserts in isolation from a disturbance detector operation, the trip will \nbe delayed for two cycles. See TRQUAL Qualified Trip Conditions on \npage 5.4 for full details.\n\nTrip Settings DTA, \nDTB, DTC\n\nThe DTT and DUTT tripping schemes are realized with SELOGIC control \nequation trip settings DTA, DTB, DTC, discussed at the beginning of this \nsection. \n\nMIRRORED BITS® protocol default settings provide adequate security for \nPOTT, DCB, and DCUB applications. Set the receive bit security counter \nRMB1PU – RMB8PU = 2 when using MIRRORED BITS protocol for DTT \napplications or any other tripping scheme that is unsupervised by a local fault \ndetector. For example, if Direct Transfer Tripping SELOGIC control equation \nDTT is set to\n\nDTA = RMB3A\n\nmake the receive bit security counter setting \n\nRMB3PU = 2\n\non MIRRORED BITS Port A.\n\nWhen RMB3PU = 2 on MIRRORED BITS Port A, the MIRRORED BITS protocol \nrequires reception of two sequential MIRRORED BITS messages with RMB3 \nasserted (deasserted) before allowing Relay Word Bit RMB3A to assert \n(deassert). \n\nTrip Settings E3PT, \nEWFC, Z2GTSP, \n67QGSP\n\nSingle-pole trip conditions are controlled by the enable settings EWFC, \nZ2GTSP, 67QGSP, and SELOGIC control equation E3PT.\n\nE3PT\nSELOGIC control equation E3PT can be used to select when a three-phase trip \nis appropriate. Setting E3PT does not trip the circuit breaker by itself, but \nenables the three-phase trip logic.\n\n➤ When E3PT is asserted to logical 1, any new TRIP condition \nwill operate all three circuit breaker poles.\n\n➤ When E3PT = logical 0, a new TRIP condition will be \nprocessed as either a single-pole trip or a three-pole trip, \ndepending on the elements asserted, or the other settings \nEWFC, Z2GTSP, and 67QGSP.\n\nBecause E3PT is a SELOGIC control equation, it can be set dynamically. For \nexample, some applications may require it to evaluate to logical 0 for the first \ntrip in an auto-reclose sequence and logical 1 for any subsequent trips.\n\nEWFC\nWeak-Infeed setting EWFC = SP enables single-pole tripping for Echo \nConversion to Trip (ECTT) conditions. The SEL-311C uses phase \nundervoltage to trip only the pole(s) that are experiencing the weak infeed \ncondition when ECTT asserts. The undervoltage elements 27AWI, 27BWI, \nand 27CWI are controlled by setting 27PWI. However, if SELOGIC equation \nE3PT = logical 1 when ECTT asserts, the EWFC = SP selection is overridden \nand all three poles are tripped.\n\n\n\n5.26\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nCommunications-Assisted Trip Logic—General Overview\n\nWeak-Infeed setting EWFC = Y enables three-pole tripping for Echo \nConversion to Trip (ECTT) conditions. In this configuration, SELOGIC control \nequation E3PT has no effect on ECTT trips because the ECTT trips will \nalways be three-pole.\n\nWeak-Infeed setting EWFC = N disables tripping for Echo Conversion to Trip \n(ECTT) conditions.\nThe EWFC setting is available when ECOMM = POTT, DCUB1, or DCUB2. \n\nThe 27PWI setting is available when EWFC = Y or SP.\n\nZ2GTSP\nThe Zone 2 Ground Distance Time Delay Single-Pole (Z2GTSP) trip enable \nsetting controls the SEL-311C trip characteristics for ground distance element \noperation. When Z2GTSP = Y, any TRIP condition that occurs when the \nZone 2 ground distance time-delayed element Z2GT is asserted will cause a \nsingle-pole trip. This single-pole trip condition is overridden if SELOGIC \nequation E3PT = logical 1 at the time of TRIP.\n\nWhen Z2GTSP = N, any TRIP condition that occurs when only the Zone 2 \nground-distance time-delayed element Z2GT is asserted will cause a \nthree-pole trip.\n\nTrips that occur when the Zone 1 ground element (Z1G) is asserted are always \nsingle-pole trip, regardless of the Z2GTSP setting (again, provided that E3PT \nis not asserted).\n\n67QGSP\nThe Zone 2 directional overcurrent negative-sequence/residual-overcurrent \nsingle-pole trip enable setting controls the SEL-311C trip characteristics for \nCOMPRM TRIP conditions that do not include a distance element.\n\nWhen 67QGSP = Y, the SEL-311C can assert a single-pole trip during high \nresistance ground faults such that the fault impedance lies outside of the \nground distance protection characteristics; the FIDS logic selects the faulted \nphase when residual directional overcurrent elements provide \ncommunications-assisted tripping. This single-pole trip condition is \noverridden if SELOGIC control equation E3PT = logical 1 at the time of TRIP.\n\nWhen 67QGSP = N, communications-assisted tripping will only be successful \nif a ground distance element asserts to select the appropriate phase to trip. \n\nIf the application includes the possibility of communications-assisted tripping \nwithout the ground-distance elements, consider using the E3PT SELOGIC \ncontrol equation to select three-phase tripping when no phase decision can be \nmade. Other approaches include using direct trip SELOGIC control equations \nDTA, DTB, and DTC.\n\n\n\n5.27\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nCommunications-Assisted Trip Logic—General Overview\n\nUse Existing SEL-321 \nApplication Guides \nfor the SEL-311C\n\nThe communications-assisted tripping schemes settings in the SEL-311C are \nvery similar to those in the SEL-321. Existing SEL-321 application guides can \nalso be used in setting up these schemes in the SEL-311C. The following \napplication guides are available from SEL.\n\n➤ AG93-06 Applying the SEL-321 Relay to Directional \nComparison Blocking (DCB) Schemes\n\n➤ AG95-29 Applying the SEL-321 Relay to Permissive \nOverreaching Transfer Trip (POTT) Schemes\n\n➤ AG96-19 Applying the SEL-321 Relay to Directional \nComparison Unblocking (DCUB) Schemes\n\nThe major differences are how the optoisolated input settings and the trip \nsettings are made. The following explanations describe these differences.\n\nOptoisolated Input Settings Differences Between the SEL-321 and \nSEL-311C Relays\n\nThe SEL-311C does not have optoisolated input settings like the SEL-321. \nRather, the optoisolated inputs of the SEL-311C are available because Relay \nWord bits are used in SELOGIC control equations. The following optoisolated \ninput setting example is for a Permissive Overreaching Transfer Trip (POTT) \nscheme.\n\nIn the above SEL-311C setting example, Relay Word bit IN102 is set in the \nPT1 SELOGIC control equation. Optoisolated input IN102 is wired to a \ncommunications equipment receiver output contact. Relay Word bit IN102 \ncan also be used in other SELOGIC control equations in the SEL-311C. See \nOptoisolated Inputs on page 7.1 for more information on optoisolated inputs.\n\nTrip Settings Differences Between the SEL-321 and SEL-311C Relays\nSome of the SELOGIC control equation trip settings of the SEL-321 and \nSEL-311C relays are not operationally different, just labeled differently. The \ncorrespondence is listed below.\n\nCertain models of the SEL-321 and the SEL-311C described in this manual \nuse trip unlatch option setting TULO. The SEL-311C TULO details are shown \nin Figure 5.2 and described in Unlatch Trip on page 5.12.\n\nCertain models of the SEL-321 and the SEL-311C described in this manual \nfeature single-pole trip logic.\n\nSEL-321 SEL-311C\n\nIN102 = PT PT1 = IN102 (received permissive trip)\n\nSEL-321 SEL-311C\n\nMTCS TRCOMM (Communications-Assisted Trip Conditions)\nMTO TRSOTF (Switch-Onto-Fault Trip Conditions)\nMTU TR or TRQUAL (Unconditional or Other Trip Conditions)\n\nBKMTR (Manual Trip conditions)\n\n\n\n5.28\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nPermissive Overreaching Transfer Trip (POTT) Logic\n\nUsing MIRRORED BITS \nto Implement \nCommunications- \nAssisted Tripping \nSchemes\n\nThe MIRRORED BITS relay-to-relay communications protocol is available in \nSEL-311C relays, in addition to many other SEL products. MIRRORED BITS \nimplementations have the following advantages over traditional \ncommunications equipment:\n\n➤ Less equipment (increases reliability)\n➤ Increased speed (no contact closure delay)\n➤ Better security (through built-in channel monitoring)\n➤ Reduced wiring complexity\n\nUse MIRRORED BITS communications to implement any of these tripping \nschemes efficiently and economically. MIRRORED BITS technology is \ngenerally used with either POTT or DCUB tripping schemes. If the \ncommunications channel is reliable and noise-free, e.g., dedicated fiber optic, \nthen POTT gives unsurpassed security and very good dependability. If the \ncommunications channel is less than perfect, but communications channel \nfailures are not likely to be coincident with external faults, then DCUB gives a \nvery good combination of security and dependability.\n\nThe subsections that follow use traditional communications equipment in the \nexamples. If using MIRRORED BITS communications, change some of the \nSELOGIC control equations to use Transmit MIRRORED BITS instead of output \ncontacts, and Receive MIRRORED BITS instead of optoisolated inputs. Also, \nMIRRORED BITS communications do not require dc wiring between the relay \nand communications equipment.\n\nSee Appendix H: MIRRORED BITS Communications for details on configuring a \nrelay port to communicate using MIRRORED BITS.\n\nSeveral Application Guides available on the SEL website (www.selinc.com) \ngive application examples of MIRRORED BITS in communications-assisted \ntripping schemes. Although some of the guides were written for the \nSEL-321-1 distance relays, these relays are similar to SEL-311C relays, so the \nguides will still be helpful in designing SEL-311C applications.\n\nPermissive Overreaching Transfer Trip (POTT) Logic\nEnable the POTT logic by setting ECOMM = POTT. The POTT logic in Figure 5.9 \nis also enabled for directional comparison unblocking schemes (ECOMM = \nDCUB1 or ECOMM = DCUB2). The POTT logic performs the following tasks.\n\n➤ Keys communication equipment to send permissive trip when \nany element included in the SELOGIC control equation \ncommunications-assisted trip equation TRCOMM asserts and \nthe current reversal logic is not asserted.\n\n➤ Prevents keying and tripping by the POTT logic following a \ncurrent reversal.\n\n➤ Echoes the received permissive signal to the remote terminal.\n\n➤ Prevents channel lockup during echo and test.\n\n➤ Provides a secure means of tripping for weak- and/or \nzero-infeed line terminals.\n\n➤ Allows the Zone 1 distance elements to reset the current reversal \ndetection timer. This allows the local relay to immediately send \npermission to trip to the remote relay if a fault is detected in Zone 1.\n\n\n\n5.29\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nPermissive Overreaching Transfer Trip (POTT) Logic\n\nSingle-Pole Trip \nConsiderations\n\nThe SEL-311C uses a single-communications-channel implementation of the \nPOTT scheme, and this design is suitable for many applications.\n\nFor certain simultaneous faults in parallel line applications, this \nsingle-channel design lacks phase selectivity because the remote phase \ninformation is not available.

If the fault \nlies within the Zone 1 reach of the strong terminal, the fault currents may \nredistribute after the strong terminal line breaker opens, and this current \nredistribution may permit sequential tripping of the weak-infeed terminal line \nbreaker. If currents do not redistribute sufficiently to operate the protective \nelements at the weak-infeed terminal, it is still desirable to open the local \nbreaker. This prevents the low level currents from maintaining the fault arc \nand allows successful autoreclosure from the strong terminal. When the fault \n\n\n\n5.31\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nPermissive Overreaching Transfer Trip (POTT) Logic\n\nlocation is near the weak terminal, the Zone 1 elements of the strong terminal \ndo not pick up, and the fault is not cleared rapidly. This is because the weak \nterminal protective elements do not operate. \n\nNote that while the weak-infeed terminal contributes little fault current, the \nphase voltage(s) are depressed.\nThe weak-infeed logic and settings are available for ECOMM = POTT, \nDCUB1, or DCUB2 applications.\n\nSEL-311C Weak-Infeed Logic Settings\nEnable the weak-infeed logic by setting EWFC = Y for three-phase weak-infeed \ntripping or SP for single-phase weak-infeed tripping. Making one of these settings \nchoices exposes additional settings 27PPW, 27PWI, and 59NW.\n\nDisable the weak-infeed logic by setting EWFC = N.\n\nThe SEL-311C provides additional logic (see Figure 5.9) for weak-infeed \nterminals to permit rapid tripping of both line terminals for internal faults near \nthe weak terminal. The strong terminal is permitted to trip via the permissive \nsignal echoed back from the weak terminal. The weak-infeed logic generates a \ntrip at the weak terminal if all of the following are true.\n\n➤ A permissive trip (PT) signal is received (from the strong \nterminal) for ETDPU time.\n\n➤ A phase-to-phase undervoltage or residual overvoltage element \npicked up.\n\n➤ No reverse-looking elements are picked up.\n\n➤ All three poles of the circuit breaker are closed.\n\n➤ No loss-of-potential (LOP) condition is present when ELOP = Y1.\nAfter these conditions are met, the weak-infeed logic sets the \nEcho-Conversion-To-Trip (ECTT) bit in the Relay Word. The ECTT bit is \nincluded in the trip logic (see Figure 5.1) and a trip signal is issued to the local \nbreaker when the conditions described above are true.\n\nTypical phase-to-phase undervoltage setting (27PPW) is 70–80 percent of the \nlowest expected system operating voltage, on a phase-to-phase basis. \n\nThe residual overvoltage setting should be set to approximately twice the expected \nstanding 3V0 voltage. With the 59NW element set at twice the nominal standing \n3V0 voltage, the instrument measures only fault-induced zero-sequence voltage.\n\nWhen EWFC = Y, all three phases are tripped during ECTT conditions.\n\nWhen EWFC = SP, the phase undervoltage setting (27PWI) is used to detect \nwhich phase voltages are depressed, as shown at the bottom of Figure 5.9. A \ntypical setting is 70-80 percent of the lowest expected system operating \nvoltage on a phase-to-neutral basis. The resulting undervoltage Relay Word \nbits 27AWI, 27BWI, and 27CWI are used in Figure 5.1 to select which \nphase(s) to trip during ECTT conditions.\n\n\n\n5.32\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nPermissive Overreaching Transfer Trip (POTT) Logic\n\nq From Figure 4.1; w from Figure 3.2; e from Figure 3.5; r from Figure 3.27; t from Figure 3.28; y from Figure 5.6; \nu from Figure 5.8; i from Figure 5.1; o Figure 5.1.\n\nFigure 5.9 POTT Logic\n\nTR\nCO\n\nMM\n(S\n\net\ntin\n\ng)\n\nEL\nOP\n\n =\n Y\n\n1\n(S\n\net\ntin\n\ng)\nq\n\n LO\nP\n\ne\n Z\n\n1G\n\nw\n M\n\n1P\n\nw\n M\n\n3P\ne\n\n Z\n3G\n\nr\n 67\n\nG3\nt\n\n 67\nQ3\n\ny\n 3\n\nPO\n\nEB\nLK\n\nD \n= \n\nOF\nF\n\n(S\net\n\ntin\ng)\n\nOP\nO \n\n= \n27\n\n(S\net\n\ntin\ng)\n\nET\nDP\n\nU \n= \n\nOF\nF\n\n(S\net\n\ntin\ng)\n\nu\n P\n\nT\n\nEW\nFC\n\n =\n Y,\n\n S\nP\n\n(S\net\n\ntin\ng)\n\n|V\nAB\n\n|\n\n|V\nBC\n\n|\n\n|V\nCA\n\n|\n\n27\nPP\n\nW\n(S\n\net\ntin\n\ng)\n\n|3\nV0\n\n|\n\n59\nNW\n\n(S\net\n\ntin\ng)\n\n0\n\nEB\nLK\n\nD\n\n0\n\n1/4 CY\nC\n\n0\n\n1/4 CY\nC\n\n0\n\nZ3\nRB\n\nD\n\n0\n\n0\n\nET\nDP\n\nU\n0\n\nED\nUR\n\nDRe\nse\n\nt\n\n+_ +_ +_ _+\n\nWF\nC\n\nEC\nTT\n\nTo\n Tr\n\nip\n Lo\n\ngi\nc o\n\nTo\n Tr\n\nip\n \n\nLo\ngi\n\nc o\n\nEK\nEY\n\nKE\nY\n\nTo\n Tr\n\nip\n Lo\n\ngi\nc o\n\nZ3\nRB\n\nRe\nla\n\ny\nWo\n\nrd\nBi\n\nts\n\nRe\nla\n\ny\nWo\n\nrd\nBi\n\nts\n\nRi\nsin\n\ng \nEd\n\nge\n D\n\net\nec\n\nt\n\nRe\nse\n\nt\n\nET\nDP\n\nU \n+ \n\nED\nUR\n\nD \n+ \n\n1 C\nYC\n\nRe\nla\n\ny\nWo\n\nrd\nBi\n\nts\n(u\n\nnl\nes\n\ns n\not\n\ned\n)\n\ni\n 3\n\nPT\n\n|V\nA|\n\n27\nAW\n\nI\n\n27\nBW\n\nI\n\n27\nCW\n\nI\n\n|V\nB|\n\n|V\nC|\n\n27\nPW\n\nI\n(S\n\net\ntin\n\ng)\n\n+_ +_ +_\n\n\n\n5.33\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nPermissive Overreaching Transfer Trip (POTT) Logic\n\nq Figure 5.13; w Figure 5.1.\n\nFigure 5.10 Permissive Input Logic Routing to Trip Logic\n\nVariations for \nPermissive \nUnderreaching \nTransfer Trip (PUTT) \nScheme\n\nRefer to Figure 5.7 and Figure 5.9.

In breaker failure schemes, it is important to \nquickly detect the dropout of fault-detecting overcurrent elements. Fault \ndetector dropout can be delayed by the presence of subsidence current, which \nresults from the energy trapped in the CT magnetizing branch after the circuit \nbreaker opens to clear a fault or interrupt load. Subsidence current decays \nexponentially and delays the dropout of filtered instantaneous overcurrent \nelements. The open-pole detection logic of the SEL-311C uses unfiltered data \nto identify a breaker open pole and reset the breaker failure logic in less than \none cycle, even when subsidence current is present. \n\nBreaker Failure \nCurrent Detectors\n\nFigure 5.20 shows how the A-phase open-pole detection logic controls the \nbreaker failure current detector. Logic for B-phase and C-phase is similar. \nWhen a breaker fails to trip during a fault, the A-phase open-pole detection \nlogic remains deasserted. If the phase current, IA, is greater than breaker \nfailure current pickup threshold, 50BFP, Relay Word bits 50BFA and 50BFT \nassert. If the breaker trips, phase current IA may remain above the breaker \nfailure current pickup threshold 50BFP for some time because of subsidence. \nThe open-pole detection logic detects this and asserts, causing 50BFA and \n50BFT to deassert. \n\nThe breaker failure current pickup is usually set above maximum load.\n\nTX\n\nIN106IN104\n\nBT = IN104 + IN106\n\nSEL-311C\n(Partial)\n\nRX\n\n85CO To / From \nRemote \nTerminal 2\n\nSTOPSTART\n(TX) (TX)\n\n(RX)\n\nOUT208\n\nTX\n\nOUT106 OUT107\n\n(+)\n\nOUT105 = DSTRT + NSTRT\nOUT106 = STOP\nOUT107 = DSTRT + NSTRT\nOUT108 = STOP\n\nOUT105\n\nRX\n\n(—)\n\n(RX)START STOP\n(TX)(TX)\n\nTo / From \nRemote \nTerminal 1\n\n\n\n5.45\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nBreaker Failure Protection\n\nFigure 5.20 Breaker Failure Current Detector Logic for A-Phase\n\nBreaker Failure Logic Figure 5.21 shows the breaker failure logic for Phase A. Phases B and C are \nsimilar. Fault current causes 50BFA to assert immediately following fault \ninception and just prior to the assertion of SELOGIC control equation BFIA \n(Breaker Failure Initiate). Program BFIA with internal breaker failure initiate \nconditions, such as the Relay Word bit TRIP, or breaker failure initiate signals \nfrom external devices communicated to the relay through contact inputs or \nMIRRORED BITS communications. When BFIA asserts, timer BFPU (Breaker \nFailure Trip Timer) starts timing. If 50BFA remains asserted when the BFPU \ntimer expires, Relay Word bit BFTA asserts. Use this Relay Word bit in the \ncircuit breaker failure tripping logic to cause a circuit breaker failure trip (see \nBreaker Failure Trip Logic on page 5.46). If the protected circuit breaker \nopens successfully, 50BFA deasserts before the BFPU timer expires and \nBFTA and BFT do not assert.\n\nIf the breaker failure logic of Figure 5.21 does not match your preferred \nbreaker failure scheme, Relay Word bits 50BFA, 50BFB, 50BFC, and 50BFT \nmay be used along with SELOGIC control equation variables to create custom \nschemes. Use the breaker failure trip logic (Figure 5.22) to ensure that breaker \nfailure trip signals are properly latched.\n\nFigure 5.21 Breaker Failure Logic, Phase A. Phase B and Phase C Are Similar\n\nRetrip Logic Some three-pole circuit breakers have two separate trip coils. If one trip coil \nfails, the local protection can energize the second trip coil to attempt to trip the \nbreaker again. Configure your protection system to attempt a local retrip using \nthe second trip coil before the circuit breaker failure pickup timer expires.\n\nRTPU (Breaker Failure Retrip Timer) begins timing when BFIA asserts. Relay \nWord bit RTA asserts when RTPU times out. Program a contact output to \nenergize the second circuit breaker trip coil when Relay Word bit RTA asserts.\n\n50BFA\n\nB- and C-phase logic is similar\n\n50BFB\n\n50BFC\n\n50BFT\n50BFP\n\n(Setting)\n\nIA\n\n_\n\n+\n\nPhase A Open\nPole Detection\n\nLogic\n\nRelay\nWord\nBit\n\nRelay\nWord\nBit\n\nRelay\nWord\nBits\n\nBFIA\n(SELOGIC\nSetting)\n\n50BFA\n\nBFTB\n\nBFTA\n\nRTA\n\nBFTC\n\nRTB\n\nRTC\n\nRelay\nWord\nBit\n\nRelay\nWord\nBit\n\nBFPU\n\n0\n\nRTPU\n\n0\n\nBFT\n\nRelay\nWord\nBits\n\nRelay\nWord\nBits\n\nRT\n\n\n\n5.46\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nBreaker Failure Protection\n\nBreaker Failure \nTrip Logic\n\nUsually, SELOGIC control equation BFTR (Breaker Failure Trip Equation) includes \nRelay Word bit BFT.

These are either factory \n\ndefined (fixed function), or programmable LEDs in certain ordering \nconfigurations.\n\nFor simplicity, Target and Status LEDs are called Target LEDs in the other \nsections of this manual, and in this section where the distinction between \ntarget and status LED is not important.\n\nHere is a summary of two types of front-panel target and status LEDs.\n\n➤ Fixed target logic and status LEDs that mimic the target LEDs \nfound in previous SEL-311C relays.\n\n➤ Programmable target and status LEDs which can be customized \nthrough Global and Logic settings changes. With default settings, \nthe programmable LEDs mimic the fixed target LEDs.\n\nBoth types of target and status LEDs are specified in this section, with \ndifferences highlighted.\n\nFront-Panel Features The SEL-311C target and status LEDs are prominently displayed on the front \npanel of the relay, adjacent to the human-machine interface (HMI). See \nFigure 2.2 through Figure 2.6 for sample front-panel configurations. \n\nThe target and status LEDs are separate from the other components of the \nfront-panel interface. These other features are covered in other sections of this \ninstruction manual.\n\n➤ The ten available operator control pushbuttons and indication \nLEDs (shown in Figure 2.4 and Figure 2.6) are described in \nSection 11: Front-Panel Interface.\n\n➤ The two-line liquid crystal display (LCD) and associated \nfront-panel pushbuttons are described in Section 11: \nFront-Panel Interface.\n\n➤ The use of Rotating Display Points to automatically display \nstatus messages and certain analog information is described in \nRotating Display on page 7.38.\n\n➤ The optional SafeLock® Trip/Close pushbuttons and indicator \nLEDs are described in Section 2: Installation.\n\nBFTB Phase B circuit breaker failure\n\nBFTC Phase C circuit breaker failure\n\nBFT Any phase circuit breaker failure\n\nRTA Phase A retrip\n\nRTB Phase B retrip\n\nRTC Phase C retrip\n\nRT Retrip\n\nBFTRIP Circuit breaker failure trip\n\nTable 5.5 Breaker Failure Protection Logic Outputs (Sheet 2 of 2)\n\nRelay \nWord Bit\n\nDefinition Application\n\nNOTE: Do not use this Instruction \nManual information to order a relay. \nPlease refer to the up-to-date product \nconfiguration available online, or \ncontact your SEL Customer Service \nRepresentative.\n\n\n\n5.48\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nFront-Panel Target LEDs\n\nFixed Target Logic The SEL-311C fixed target logic is listed in Table 5.6. See Figure 2.2, \nFigure 2.3, and Figure 2.5 for example front-panels with fixed target logic.\n\nFor remote operations, the status of the LEDs can be checked using the TAR 0 \nand TAR 1 command. See Table 5.7 for a cross reference, and TAR Command \n(Display Relay Element Status) on page 10.73 for more command options.\n\nThe LEDs designated as Target Type LEDs in Table 5.6 are updated and then latched for every new assertion \n(rising edge) of the TRIP Relay Word bit. The TRIP Relay Word bit is an output of the trip logic (see Figure 5.1).\nFurther target LED information follows.\n\nAdditional Target LED Information\nTRIP Target LED\n\nThe TRIP target LED illuminates at the rising edge of trip (the new assertion of \nthe TRIP Relay Word bit).\nThe TRIP target LED is especially helpful in providing front-panel indication \nfor tripping that does not involve the other targeting elements. If the trip is not \na distance or overcurrent element generated trip, none of the other target LEDs \n(TLED13–TLED15 and TLED18–TLED26) in Table 5.6 illuminate, but the \n\nTable 5.6 Fixed Target and Status LED Definitions \n\nRelay Word Bit\n(TAR 0 and TAR 1)\n\nLED Label Definition Type\n\nTLED11 EN Relay Enabled—see Relay Self-Tests on page 13.7 Status\nTLED12 TRIP Indication that a trip occurred, by a protection or control element Target\n\nTLED13 TIME Time-delayed trip Target\n\nTLED14 COMM Communications-assisted trip Target\n\nTLED15 SOTF Switch-onto-fault trip Target\n\nTLED16 RS Reclosing relay in reset state Status\n\nTLED17 LO Reclosing relay in lockout state Status\n\nTLED18 51 Time-overcurrent element trip Target\n\nTLED19 A Phase A involved in the fault Target\n\nTLED20 B Phase B involved in the fault Target\n\nTLED21 C Phase C involved in the fault Target\n\nTLED22 G Ground distance or residual ground element picked up at a time of trip Target\n\nTLED23 1 Zone/Level 1 element picked up at time of trip Target\n\nTLED24 2 Zone/Level 2 element picked up at time of trip Target\n\nTLED25 3 Zone/Level 3 element picked up at time of trip Target\n\nTLED26 4 Zone/Level 4 element picked up at time of trip Target\n\nNOTE: Unlike legacy SEL-311C \nmodels, the TAR command response \nshows the Relay Word bit name (e.g., \nTLED11, TLED12) rather than the LED \nlabels (EN, TRIP, etc.).\n\nTable 5.7 SEL-311C Status/Target LED Cross Reference for TAR Command (Fixed Target Logic)\n\nTAR Command\nRelay Word Bit\n\n(Corresponding LED Label)\n\nTAR 0 TLED11 TLED12 TLED13 TLED14 TLED15 TLED16 TLED17 TLED18\n\n(EN) (TRIP) (TIME) (COMM) (SOTF) (RS) (LO) (51)\n\nTAR 1 TLED19 TLED20 TLED21 TLED22 TLED23 TLED24 TLED25 TLED26\n\n(A) (B) (C) (G) (ZONE1) (ZONE2) (ZONE3) (ZONE4)\n\n\n\n5.49\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nFront-Panel Target LEDs\n\nTRIP target LED still illuminates. Thus, tripping via the front-panel local \ncontrol (local bits), serial port (remote bits or OPEN command), or voltage \nelements is indicated only by the illumination of the TRIP target LED. \n\nTrips initiated by the manual trip SELOGIC control equation BKMTR \nilluminate the TRIP target LED only.\n\nTIME Target LED\nThe TIME target LED illuminates at the rising edge of trip if SELOGIC control \nequation setting FAULT has been asserted for more than three cycles and the \ntrip is not the direct result of SELOGIC control equations TRCOMM, \nTRSOFT, or a direct transfer trip. FAULT is usually set with distance and \ntime-overcurrent element pickups (e.g., FAULT = 51G + 51Q + M2P + Z2G) \nto detect fault inception. If tripping occurs more than three cycles after fault \ninception, the TIME target illuminates.\n\nSELOGIC control equation setting FAULT also controls other relay functions. \nSee SELOGIC Control Equation Setting FAULT on page 5.58.\n\nCOMM Target LED\nThe COMM target LED illuminates at the rising edge of trip if the trip is the sole \nand direct result of the communications-assisted trip logic, indicated by the \nCOMPRM Relay Word bit in Figure 5.1 (first panel of diagram). Elements \nthat affect COMPRM include the TRCOMM, DTA, DTB, and DTC SELOGIC \ncontrol equations and the ECTT Relay Word bit.\n\nAnother Application for the COMM Target LED\nIf none of the traditional communications-assisted trip logic is used (i.e., \nSELOGIC control equation setting TRCOMM is not used, consideration can be \ngiven to using the COMM target LED to indicate tripping via remote \ncommunications channels (e.g., via serial port commands or SCADA \nasserting optoisolated inputs). Use SELOGIC control equation settings DTA, \nDTB, and DTC (Direct Transfer Trip, A, B, and C-phase) to accomplish this.\nFor example, if Remote Bit 1 is used to command a three-phase trip from a \nremote master, and the COMM target LED should be illuminated, make these \nsettings.\n\nDTA = RB1\n\nDTB = RB1\n\nDTC = RB1\n\nE3PT = … + RB1\n\nIncluding RB1 in the enable three-pole trip setting E3PT is not strictly \nnecessary because RB1 appears in all three direct-trip equations. However, the \nE3PT = … + RB1 setting ensures that a trip output is generated even for \nbreaker poles already reported as open. This is recommended for taking lines \nout of service, in case the pole status signals are misreported. For example, \nwithout the E3PT setting modification, if the A-phase and B-phase poles were \nreported open when RB1 is received (SPOA = SPOB = logical 1), only DTC \nwould propagate through the logic and issue a trip output (TPC), as shown in \nthe first panel of Figure 5.1.\n\nAnother method is to use the manual trip setting BKMTR in place of E3PT to \nguarantee a three-phase trip.\n\nBKMTR = RB1 + other manual trip conditions\n\nNOTE: Using the manual trip setting \nBKMTR (alone) to issue a three-phase \ntrip does not illuminate the COMM \nLED.\n\n\n\n5.50\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nFront-Panel Target LEDs\n\nUsing the methods shown in this example, any Relay Word bits set in \nSELOGIC control equation settings DTp (p = A, B or C) do not have to be \nrepeated in SELOGIC control equation setting TR, because both types of \nsettings directly activate the trip logic. The only difference between settings \nDTp and the trip setting (TR) is that DTp causes the COMM target LED to \nilluminate, and the DTp settings can be used to manually trip a single phase of \nthe breaker.\n\nMany other variations of the above DTp settings examples are possible.\n\nSOTF Target LED\nThe SOTF target LED illuminates at the rising edge of the TRIP Relay Word bit \nif the trip is the sole and direct result of the SELOGIC control equation setting \nTRSOTF and associated switch-onto-fault trip logic (see Figure 5.5).\n\nRecloser RS and LO Status LEDs\nThe RS and LO LEDs follow the state of the 79RS and 79LO Relay Word bits, \nrespectively. If the reclosing relay is turned off (enable setting E79 = N or \n79OI1 = 0), all the Device 79 (reclosing relay) status LEDs are extinguished.\n\n51 Target LED\nThe 51 target LED illuminates at the rising edge of trip if a time-overcurrent \nelement (51PT, 51GT, or 51QT) is present and asserted in the SELOGIC \ncontrol equation that caused the trip.\n\nFAULT TYPE Target LEDs\nA, B, and C Target LEDs\n\nA (Phase A) target LED is illuminated one cycle after the rising edge of TRIP \nif a protection element causes the trip, and Phase A is involved in the fault \n(likewise for B [Phase B] and C [Phase C] target LEDs).\nDuring single-pole open conditions (Relay Word bit SPO = logical 1), the \ntarget logic considers the two phases that remain closed and may also assert G \nif the relay determines that ground was involved in the fault.\n\nG Target LED\nG target LED is illuminated at the rising edge of trip if the fault involved \nground or if a ground overcurrent element caused the trip.\n\nZone LEDs\nZone/Level LEDs illuminate at the rising edge of trip for the lowest zone number \nin the SELOGIC control equation that caused the trip. The elements considered are \nMnP, MnPT, ZnG, ZnGT, ZnT, 67Pn, 67PnT, 67Gn, 67GnT, 67Qn, 67QnT \n(where n = 1 to 4), Z2SEQT, M2PSEQT, Z2GSEQT, Z2PG2S, and 67QG2S.\nThese elements need only be present in the SELOGIC control equation that \ncauses the trip in order to participate in the illuminating of front-panel targets. \nNo consideration is made as to how the element is used. For example, assume \nthe SELOGIC control equation TRQUAL = IN101 * Z1G + Z2G. In this case, \nif the Z1G element is asserted at the rising edge of TRIP, the ZONE1 target \nwill light even if IN101 was not asserted and the cause of the trip was Z2G.\n\nNOTE: The SEL-311C phase targeting \nlogic requires 3-phase voltage signals \nfor proper operation.\n\n\n\n5.51\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nFront-Panel Target LEDs\n\nProgrammable \nTarget Logic\n\nSelected SEL-311C models are available with Programmable Target Logic. The \nprogrammable target logic is listed in Table 5.8. See Figure 2.4 and Figure 2.6 \nfor example front-panels with programmable target logic. These models feature \nconfigurable labels, where the default LED labels are printed on a card inside a \npocket on the relay front panel. To change the labels, the default card may be \nremoved, and a new card printed and inserted to change the target and status \nLED labels. \n\nThe SEL-311C ships with factory-default target settings and a default slide-in \ncard that gives it the same behavior as models with the fixed target logic.

Instead of leaving a target or status LED unused, \nconsider programming it for a different function.\n\nEXAMPLE 5.1 Target and Status LED Change (Changing and Moving \nLED Functions)\n\nA transmission line application uses only three out of four available \ndistance element zones, freeing-up the ZONE/LEVEL 4 LED for other \nfunctions. Assume for this example the reclosing relay is being used \nin the application, and the operating staff want to know when the \nreclosing relay is in the 79CY (cycle) state.\n\nIn Table 5.10, the easiest change to program would be to redefine the \nZONE/LEVEL 4 Target LED as a 79 CY Status LED, but this would not be \nclear when implemented on the front panel. The 4 LED is not adjacent \nto the RS and LO LEDs, and it would be difficult to print a label with \nRECLOSER CY in that position.\n\nInstead, the SEL-311C Logic and Global Settings can be used to \n“move” the 51 LED function down to the second row (in place of 4), \nand then move LO to the previous 51 location, and finally, defining a \nnew CY LED where LO was located. This layout is shown in Table 5.11.\n\nRequired setting changes, starting from factory-default settings.\nGlobal Settings (SET G or via ACSELERATOR QuickSet® SEL-5030 \nSoftware)\n\nLED17L = N {no change, LED17 shall still be a status LED}\n\nLED18L = N {the LO LED shall be a status LED, and shall not be \nincluded in event summary Target fields}\n\nLED26L = Y {no change, LED26 shall still be a target (latch on \ntrip) LED}\n\nLED17A = CY {change the alias for the new LED function}1\n\nTable 5.10 Front Panel Before Example Changes\n\nENABLED TRIP TIME COMM SOTF RS LO 51\n\nRECLOSER\n\nA B C G 1 2 3 4\n\nFAULT TYPE ZONE/LEVEL\n\nTable 5.11 Front Panel After Example Changes\n\nENABLED TRIP TIME COMM SOTF RS CY LO\n\nRECLOSER\n\nA B C G 1 2 3 51\n\nFAULT TYPE ZONE/LEVEL\n\n1 As described in the footnotes of Table 5.8, the LEDnnA (alias) settings for status type LEDs \n(when LEDnnL = N) are not used by the SEL-311C.

These Relay Word bits (LTRIP, LTIME, \netc.) are provided to mimic the fixed target logic found in other models of the \nSEL-311C.\n\nThese legacy target Relay Word bits are nonvolatile, meaning their state will \nbe retained after the relay loses power and is then powered up or if the active \nsettings group is changed. Additionally, any LEDnn can be configured to latch \non TRIP with the appropriate Global setting LEDnnL = Y. This action also \ncreates a nonvolatile LED, even if the logic expression programmed in the \nLEDnn SELOGIC control equation is not a Legacy Target logic element.\n\nAs performed in Example 5.1, these legacy functions can be moved (as done \nwith L51), or not used (as done with LZONE4). \nBecause the LEDnn settings are standard SELOGIC control equations, the \nusual operators and Relay Word bits can be used in place of the legacy target \nRelay Word bits. In Example 5.1, the 79 CY function was added merely by \nincluding Relay Word bit 79CY in the appropriate LEDnn setting.\n\nEXAMPLE 5.2 Using SELOGIC Control Equations in Target/Status \nLED Settings\n\nThis example demonstrates a few methods of programming LED \nsettings, focusing on three target LEDs.\n\nLogic settings (in all 6 groups)\nSET16 = TRIP\nRST16 = TRGTR + PB7PUL\nLED12 = LZONE1 + LZONE2\nLED13 = LZONE3 * LT16\nLED14 = 51GT * SV5T\n\nNotice that the last sample equation (for LED14) contains no legacy \ntarget logic Relay Word bits.\n\nMake the Global settings as follows.\nLED12L = Y\nLED13L = N\nLED14L = Y\nLED12A = ZONE1_2\nLED13A = ZONE3\nLED14A = GND_TOC\n\nA relay TRIP will seal-in the LED12 and LED14 logic states through the \nnormal LED logic, and the status of these LEDs are retained in \nnonvolatile memory. \n\nIn this example LED13 is configured as a status type LED, but is given \na latch-type behavior by using latch bit LT16 in the LED13 setting. This \nallows LED13 to seal-in like a regular target LED, and will have a \n\n\n\n5.55\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nFront-Panel Target LEDs\n\nnonvolatile behavior provided by the latch bit LT16 and the legacy \ntarget bit LZONE3. This example allows LED13 to be reset \nindependently of the remaining target LEDs by pressing pushbutton 7 \n(resetting LT16). The legacy target Relay Word bit LZONE3 is not \naffected by the status of LT16. \n\nIn this example, the LED13 target can also be reset by the TARGET RESET \npushbutton or TAR R command, via the TRGTR Relay Word bit (these \nactions also clear LED12 and LED13). Because Global setting \nLED13L = N, the alias setting LED13A will not appear in the target \ninformation inside event summaries.\n\nEXAMPLE 5.3 Make a Target LED Flash\n\nIf a particular LED requires more visibility, it might be programmed to \nflash when asserted. We will change LED13 in the previous example to \nmake the LED flash when a trip includes LZONE3. \n\nLogic settings (in all 6 groups)\nSV16 = !SV16T\nLED13 = LZONE3 * SV16T\n\nGroup settings (in all 6 groups)\nSV16PU = 25.00 cycles\nSV16DO = 25.00 cycles\n\nMake the Global settings as follows.\nLED13L = N\nLED13A = ZONE3\n\nA relay TRIP that asserts the LZONE3 legacy target bit will cause LED13 \nto flash. In this example, SELOGIC variable/timer SV16 is programmed to \noscillate with a period of 50 cycles. The LED13 setting logic setting \nlogically ANDs the oscillating bit with the legacy target bit. \n\nThis example requires LED13 to be configured as a status type LED, \notherwise it would not be allowed to change state. The target will \nhave nonvolatile behavior through the legacy bit LZONE3. Because \nGlobal setting LED13L = N, the alias setting LED13A will not appear in \nthe target information inside event summaries.\n\nWhen LED13 is flashing, issuing a TAR 0 command will show TLED13 \nas either asserted or deasserted, which might be misleading. If a \nremote system is configured to check relay status, it should instead \ncheck the status of Relay Word bit LZONE3, which is unaffected by \nthe oscillating behavior. Similarly, it would be better to use LZONE3 in \nthe Sequential Events Recorder (SER) settings instead of TLED13, \nwhich would create a pair of entries each time the LED flashes.\n\nResetting Front-Panel \nTarget LEDs\n\nThe front-panel target LEDs reset during the following conditions.\n\n➤ TRIP newly asserts (/TRIP).\n➤ The TARGET RESET/LAMP TEST pushbutton is pressed and TRIP is \n\nnot asserted. \n\n➤ The TAR R command is entered and TRIP is not asserted.\n\n➤ A DNP or Modbus target reset command is received and TRIP \nis not asserted.\n\n➤ The SELOGIC control equation RSTTRGT newly asserts and \nTRIP is not asserted.\n\n➤ On relays with programmable targets—when Global setting \nRSTLED = Y or Y1, and the circuit breaker closes, as detected \nby rising edge of 52A.\n\nWhen a new TRIP condition is present, the relay first clears the previous \ntargets and then rapidly refreshes them with the updated target information. \nThe relay locks-out the other target reset methods while TRIP is still active.\n\n\n\n5.56\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nFront-Panel Target LEDs\n\nThe TARGET RESET/LAMP TEST pushbutton, TAR R command, and Modbus/DNP \ntarget reset methods assert the TRGTR Relay Word bit for one processing interval.\n\nTargets are maintained in nonvolatile memory so their status is available even \nafter relay power is lost and then restored.\n\nTARGET RESET/LAMP TEST Front-Panel Pushbutton\nWhen the TARGET RESET/LAMP TEST front-panel pushbutton is pressed,\n\n➤ All front-panel LEDs illuminate for one (1) second.\n➤ All latch-type target LEDs (LEDs labeled TLED12 through \n\nTLED26 in Table 5.6 or Table 5.8) are extinguished \n(unlatched), unless a trip condition is present in which case the \nlatched target LEDs reappear in their previous state.\n\nOther Applications for the Target Reset Function\nRefer to the second panel of Figure 5.1. The combination of the TARGET RESET \npushbutton, DNP and Modbus target reset inputs, and the TAR R (Target \nReset) serial port command is available as Relay Word bit TRGTR.\nRelay Word bit TRGTR can be used to unlatch logic. For example, refer to the \nbreaker failure logic in Figure 7.26. If a breaker failure trip occurs (SV7T \nasserts), the occurrence can be displayed on the front panel with seal-in logic \nand a rotating display (see Rotating Display on page 7.38 and Rotating \nDisplay on page 11.11).\n\nSV8 = (SV8 + SV7T) * !TRGTR\n\nDP3 = SV8\n\nDP3_1 = BREAKER FAILURE\n\nDP3_0 = NA (blank)\n\nFigure 5.24 Seal-in of Breaker Failure Occurrence for Message Display\n\nIf a breaker failure trip has occurred, the momentary assertion of SV7T \n(breaker failure trip) will cause SV8 in Figure 5.24 to seal-in. Asserted SV8 in \nturn asserts DP3, causing the following message to display in the rotating \ndefault display.\n\nThis message can be removed from the display rotation by pushing the TARGET \nRESET pushbutton (Relay Word bit TRGTR pulses to logical 1, unlatching SV8 \nand in turn deasserting DP3). Thus, front-panel rotating default displays can \nbe easily reset along with the front-panel targets by pushing the TARGET RESET \npushbutton.\n\nSV7T\nBreaker Failure Trip\n\n(= logical 1)\n(= logical 0)\n\nTarget Reset\nTRGTR\n\nSV8\n\nDP3 = SV8\n\nDP3_1 = BREAKER FAILURE\nDP3_0 = (blank)\n\nBREAKER FAILURE\n\n\n\n5.57\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nFront-Panel Target LEDs\n\nSELOGIC Control Equation Setting RSTTRGT\nThe SELOGIC control equation RSTTRGT may be used to perform a target \nreset on a programmable basis. The SEL-311C responds to the rising edge of \nthe RSTTRGT equation, and resets the target LEDs provided that TRIP is not \nasserted.\n\nFor example, to reset the targets upon receipt of a control input pulse on \nIN106, set as follows.\n\nRSTTRGT = IN106\n\nThe built-in rising edge requirement ensures that leaving IN106 asserted does \nnot continually reset the targets.\n\nHowever, if RSTTRGT is asserted at relay power-up, the relay resets the \ntargets. If there is any chance the controlling condition can remain asserted, \ninsert a rising-edge operator in the setting to eliminate the chance for an \nunwanted reset. Continuing with the same example, set as shown below.\n\nRSTTRGT = /IN106\n\nOther control methods could use a SELOGIC timer or a remote bit to initiate \nthe target reset.\n\nRSTTRGT is also available as a Relay Word bit, and can be added to the SER \ntrigger settings and monitored in the SER. See Sequential Events Recorder \n(SER) Report on page 12.28.\n\nOptional Logic to Clear Trip Seal-In and Reset Targets\nAs previously noted, if the ULTR (unlatch trip) setting is not asserted, a \nsealed-in TRIP Relay Word bit can be cleared by one of the target reset \nconditions that asserts the TRGTR Relay Word bit, as shown in Figure 5.1.\n\nNote that the RSTTRGT SELOGIC control equation does not drive the \nTRGTR Relay Word bit. If an application requires a trip unlatch function \nbased on the RSTTRGT setting, the logic used in the RSTTRGT SELOGIC \ncontrol equation setting may be added to the ULTR setting. Continuing from \nthe previous example with RSTTRGT = /IN106, an appropriate ULTR setting \nis shown below.\n\nULTR = IN106 + (existing unlatch trip settings)\n\nBecause of the relay logic processing order, including Relay Word bit \nRSTTRGT in SELOGIC control equation ULTR will unlatch a sealed-in TRIP \nbut will not reset the targets.\n\nUsing RSTLED Setting in Auto-Reclose Applications \n(models with programmable Target Logic)\n\nWhen using RSTLED = Y or Y1, the target-type LEDs are reset upon breaker \nclosure (determined by the rising edge of Relay Word bit 52A). This function \nworks for any manual or automatic close operation, as long as the TRIP Relay \nWord bit is not asserted.\n\nIn the SEL-311C, the event summary subsystem collects the target LED status \nfrom the last row of an event report and places the target alias text for each \nasserted target LED in the target field. With default settings, if the ZONE 1 \ntarget LED is asserted for a trip operation, the LED23A = ZONE1 setting \ncauses ZONE1 to appear in the TARGETS field of the SUM command and \nHIS command.\n\nNOTE: The RSTTRGT function does \nnot assert the TRGTR Relay Word bit.\n\nNOTE: The RSTLED setting (Y, Y1, N, \nN1) also affects the behavior of \npushbutton 5 and LED5, as described \nin Programmable Operator Controls \non page 11.14.\n\n\n\n5.58\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nTrip and Target Logic\nFront-Panel Target LEDs\n\nIf the LER setting (length of event report) is longer than the recloser open \ninterval time (e.g., 79OI1 = 120.00 cycles, and LER = 180 cycles), it is \npossible for the breaker to trip and reclose during a single event report. In this \nsituation, using RSTLED = Y or Y1 will cause the target LEDs to reset as \nsoon as the closed breaker condition is detected (/52A). This causes the event \nsummary logic to miss the targets when it scans the final row of the event \nreport.\n\nTo preserve targeting information, consider one of these solutions.\n\n1. Use a shorter LER setting to make the length of the event report \nless than the reclosing relay open interval time.\n\n2. Use longer open interval time(s).\n3. Change RSTLED to N or N1 and manually reset targets.\n\n4. Change RSTLED to N or N1 and automatically reset targets \nusing a time delay.\n\nSolution 1 is the best if there is any chance of a trip – reclose – trip sequence \nappearing in the same event report. The fault locator can only operate on the \nfirst fault, and if targets are reported, they would be from the second fault.\n\nSolution 4 can be programmed this way.\n\nGroup settings (in all 6 groups)\nSV2PU = 200.00 cycles (must be longer than the LER setting)\nSV2DO = 0.00 cycles\n\nLogic settings (in all 6 groups)\nSV2 = 52A\nRSTTRGT = /SV2T\n\nSELOGIC Control \nEquation Setting \nFAULT\n\nSELOGIC control equation setting FAULT has control over or is used in the \nfollowing.\n\n➤ Front-panel target LED TIME.

If you are not using the \nSEL-311C for automatic reclosing, but using it to close the breaker for other \nconditions (such as manual close initiation via serial port or optoisolated \noutputs), focus on the Breaker Status Logic and Close Logic subsections. Note \nparticularly the description of SELOGIC® control equation setting CL in the \nClose Logic subsection.\n\nBreaker Status Logic—Breaker Status Logic shows how the breaker status \n(Relay Word bits 52AA, 52AB, 52AC, and 52A) is derived.\n\nClose Logic—This subsection describes the final logic that controls the \nclose output contact (e.g., OUT105 = CLOSE). This output contact \ncloses the circuit breaker for automatic reclosures and other conditions \n(e.g., manual close initiation via serial port or optoisolated inputs).\n\nReclose Supervision Logic—Reclose Supervision Logic describes the logic \nthat supervises automatic reclosing when an open-interval time times \nout: a final condition check right before the close logic asserts the \nclose output.\n\nReclosing Relay Logic—This subsection describes the remaining reclosing \nrelay settings and logic needed for automatic reclosing. The reclose \nenable setting, E79, has setting choices N, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The default \nsetting E79 = N defeats the reclosing relay. Setting choices 1–4 are the \nnumber of desired automatic reclosures.\n\nNOTE: Reclose enable setting E79 = \nN defeats the reclosing relay, but does \nnot defeat the ability of the close logic \ndescribed in the first subsection \n(Figure 6.1) to close the circuit breaker \nfor other conditions via SELOGIC \ncontrol equation setting CL.\n\n\n\n6.2\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nClose and Reclose Logic\nBreaker Status Logic\n\nFigure 6.1 Close Logic and Reclosing Relay Logic Overview\n\nBreaker Status Logic\nThe SEL-311C breaker status logic consists of four SELOGIC control equation \nsettings: 52AA, 52AB, 52AC, and 52A, and the corresponding Relay Word \nbits, as shown in Figure 6.2.\n\n52AA = Breaker Pole A status (typically driven by a relay input)\n52AB = Breaker Pole B status (typically driven by a relay input)\n52AC = Breaker Pole C status (typically driven by a relay input)\n52A = Combined breaker status (typically a SELOGIC control equation)\n\nThe SEL-311C only considers the combined 52A Relay Word bit in the close \nand reclose logic described in the following subsections. In order for \nautomatic reclosing to function, the 52A logic must deassert when one or \nmore circuit breaker poles are open.\n\nIf 52A is set with numeral 0, all internal close logic is inoperable and the \nreclosing relay is defeated. \n\nThe SEL-311C may use the individual phase breaker status signals 52AA, \n52AB, and 52AC as part of other relay functions, as described in Pole-Open \nLogic on page 5.18.\n\nFigure 6.2 Breaker Status Logic\n\nDrive-to-Lockout\n\nInitiate, Stall, Block Reset, etc.\n\nBreaker Status, Trip\nMain \n\nReclosing \nRelay \nLogic\n\n52A, TRIP\n\n79DTL\n\nRelay\nWord\nBits\n\nRelay\nWord\nBits\n\n79RI, 79RIS\n79DLS, 79SKP\n79STL, 79BRS\n\n79SEQ\n\nSELOGIC\nSetting\n\nSELOGIC\nSetting\n\nReclose Supervision\n79CLS\n\nClose Conditions Other Than Auto-Reclose\nCL\n\nUnlatch Close\nULCL CF\n\nClose Failure\n\nCLOSE\nClose \n\nRCSF\n\nOPTMN, RSTMN\n79RS, 79CY\n79LO, SH0, SH1,\nSH2 SH3, SH4\n\nReclose Supervision Failure\n\nTiming, State, Shot\n\nReclose \nSupervision\n\nLogic\n\nClose \nLogic\n\nNOTE: The available SafeLock® CLOSE \npushbutton is electrically separate \nfrom the rest of the relay and not part \nof the close logic in Figure 6.5.

If the relay senses voltage on Bus 2, voltage on the monitored \nline phase, and load current on at least one phase of the line, a reclose is \nattempted. This method requires the reclosing relay open interval times (not \nshown) to be set longer on the SEL-311C(2) to allow the SEL-311C(1) \nterminal to reclose first.\n\nIf SEL-311C(1) recloses and remains closed, SEL-311C(2) will also close, \nprovided there is some power being transferred over the two closed phases, \nindicating that Bus 1 and Bus 2 are synchronized.\n\nIf SEL-311C(1) recloses and then trips to lockout or does not attempt a reclose \nbecause of a supervising condition, SEL-311C(2) will not reclose because \neither 27S will be asserted, indicating a dead line, or 50L will be deasserted, \nindicating no line current is present. After 10 seconds in SPO, the pole \ndiscordance logic will issue a three-pole trip (3PT) to breaker 52/2 and drive \nthe reclosing relay to lockout.\n\nThis functionality requires the following reclose supervision settings:\n 79CLSD = 0.00 cycles (only one check)\n79CLS = (25A1 * 3PO) + (3P59 * !27S * 50L * SPO)\n\nSee Block Synchronism-Check Conditions on page 3.62 for information on \nhow to configure SELOGIC control equation setting BSYNCH for use with \nsingle-pole tripping.\n\nOther Setting Considerations for SEL-311C(1) and SEL-311C(2) Relays\nRefer to Skip Shot and Stall Open-Interval Timing Settings (79SKP and \n79STL, respectively) on page 6.27.\nSELOGIC control equation setting 79STL stalls open interval timing if it \nasserts. If setting 79STL is deasserted, open interval timing can continue. The \nSEL-311C(1) has no intentional open interval timing stall condition (circuit \nbreaker 52/1 closes first after a transmission line fault).\n\n79STL = 0 (numeral 0)\nThe SEL-311C(2) starts open interval timing after circuit breaker 52/1 at the \nremote end has reenergized the line. For three-phase tripping, the \nSEL-311C(2) has to see Bus 2 hot, transmission line hot, and both voltages \nsatisfy the synchronism-check logic requirements across open circuit breaker \n\nwhere:\n25A1 = selected Bus 2 phase voltage (VA, VB, or VC) is in synchronism \n\nwith monitored single-phase transmission line voltage (channel \nVS) and both are hot.\n\n3PO = Three-Pole Open\n3P59 = all three Bus 2 phase voltages (VA, VB, and VC) are hot\n!27S = NOT(27S). 27S is an undervoltage element monitoring a \n\nsingle-phase of the transmission line using channel VS.

Thus, SEL-311C(2) open interval \ntiming is stalled when the transmission line voltage and Bus 2 voltage are not \nin synchronism across open circuit breaker 52/2.\n\n79STL = !25A1 * 3PO [=NOT(25A1) AND (3PO)]\nThe 79STL example setting for the SEL-311C(2) only includes a term that \noperates for three-pole open conditions. For single-phase tripping \napplications, the SEL-311C(2) in the example wiring configuration of \nFigure 6.8 cannot reliably stall the open interval timing because only one of \nthe three phases are covered by the single-phase VS connection.\n\nIf there is a reliable communications channel between SEL-311C(1) and \nSEL-311C(2), the state of the reclosing relay in SEL-311C(1) could be shared \nwith the other terminal, and a proper decision could be made regarding stall \ntiming, and reclose supervision. \n\nCoordinate Time Delay Settings\n\nA transient condition that meets the synchronism-check requirements across a \nthree pole-open open circuit breaker 52/2 could possibly occur if circuit \nbreaker 52/1 recloses into a fault on one phase of the transmission line. The \nother two unfaulted phases would be briefly energized until circuit breaker \n52/1 is tripped again. If channel VS of the SEL-311C(2) is connected to one of \nthese briefly energized phases, synchronism-check element 25A1 could \nmomentarily assert to logical 1.\n\nSo that this possible momentary assertion of synchronism-check element \n25A1 does not cause any inadvertent reclose of circuit breaker 52/2, make \nsure the open interval timers in the SEL-311C(2) are set with some \nappreciable time greater than the momentary energization time of the faulted \ntransmission line. Or, run the synchronism-check element 25A1 through a \nprogrammable timer before using it in the preceding 79CLS and 79STL \nsettings for the SEL-311C(2) (see Figure 7.24 and Figure 7.25). Note the \nbuilt-in 3 cycle qualification of the synchronism-check voltages shown in \nFigure 3.38.\n\nAdditional Settings \nExample 2\n\nRefer to Synchronism-Check Elements on page 3.53. Also refer to Figure 6.7 \nand Figure 6.8.\n\nIf the synchronizing voltages across open circuit breaker 52/2 are “slipping” \nwith respect to one another, the Reclose Supervision Limit Timer setting \n79CLSD should be set greater than zero so there is time for the slipping \nvoltages to come into synchronism. An example is provided below.\n\n79CLSD = 60.00 cycles\n\n79CLS = 25A1 + SPO\n\nFor three-pole breaker operations, the status of synchronism-check element \n25A1 is checked continuously during the 60-cycle window. If the slipping \nvoltages come into synchronism while timer 79CLSD is timing, \nsynchronism-check element 25A1 asserts to logical 1 and reclosing proceeds.\n\nFor single-pole open conditions, no synchronism check is needed because the \nremaining closed phases bind the systems so they cannot drift out of \nsynchronism. The + SPO term ensures the 79CLS equation is satisfied for these \nconditions.\n\nIf the slipping voltages fail to come into synchronism while timer 79CLSD is \ntiming (resulting in a reclose supervision failure, causing RCSF to assert for \none processing interval), then the reclosing relay goes to the Lockout State.\n\n\n\n6.16\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nClose and Reclose Logic\nReclosing Relay\n\nIn Synchronism-Check Elements, note item 3 under Synchronism-Check \nElement Outputs on page 3.67, Voltages VP and VS are “Slipping.” Item 3 \ndescribes a last attempt for a synchronism-check reclose before timer \n79CLSD times out (or setting 79CLSD = 0.00 and only one check is made).\n\nReclosing Relay\nThe SEL-311C reclosing relay can be configured to suit many applications. \nThis subsection details the various settings, inputs, and outputs for the \nreclosing function, including some application examples. The SEL-311C \nrelay described in this manual is not preconfigured with default settings for \nauto-reclose functionality.\n\nIt is important to study all of the Section 6 material in order to design, test, and \napply the reclosing relay to the power system.\n\nNote that input\n\nReclosing Relay Open Interval Time-Out\n\nin Figure 6.6 is the logic input that is qualified by SELOGIC control equation \nsetting 79CLS, and then propagated on to the close logic in Figure 6.5 to \nautomatically reclose a circuit breaker. The explanation that follows in this \nreclosing relay subsection describes all the reclosing relay settings and logic \nthat eventually result in this open interval time-out logic input into Figure 6.6. \nOther aspects of the reclosing relay are also explained.\n\nThe reclose enable setting, E79, has setting choices N, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Setting \nE79 = N defeats the reclosing relay. Setting choices 1 through 4 are the \nnumber of desired automatic reclosures (see Open Interval Timers on \npage 6.20).\n\nReclosing Relay \nStates and General \nOperation\n\nThe SEL-311C reclosing relay is a state machine, as depicted in Figure 6.9. \nWhen running in the reclose cycle state (79CY) it can provide as many as four \nreclose attempts or “shots.”\n\nFor applications that use single-pole (SPT) and three-pole tripping (3PT), the \nnumber of automatic reclosure attempts is the total of the number of attempts, \nregardless of which type of trip occurred. See Reclosing Application for Mixed \nSingle-Pole and Three-Pole Tripping Scheme on page 6.31 for application \ndetails.\n\n\n\n6.17\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nClose and Reclose Logic\nReclosing Relay\n\nFigure 6.9 Reclosing Relay States and General Operation\n\nThe reclosing relay is in one (and only one) of these states (listed in Table 6.1) at \nany time.

See Drive-to-Lockout and \nDrive-to-Last Shot Settings (79DTL and 79DLS, Respectively) \non page 6.25).\n\n➤ The close failure timer (setting CFD) times out (see \nFigure 6.5).\n\n➤ SELOGIC control equation setting 79DTL = logical 1 (see \nDrive-to-Lockout and Drive-to-Last Shot Settings (79DTL and \n79DLS, Respectively)).\n\n➤ The Reclose Supervision Limit Timer (setting 79CLSD) times \nout (see Figure 6.6 and top of Figure 6.7) and the reclose \nenable setting, E79, is set to 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n➤ A normal reclose initiation (e.g., SELOGIC control equation \n79RI = TRIP) occurs and properly loads up an open-interval \ntime (e.g., 79OI2 = 600 cycles; see Figure 6.9). Then, before \nthe open-interval time has timed out completely (or even \nstarted timing), a subsequent unexpected reclose initiation \noccurs (e.g., flashover inside the circuit breaker tank while it is \nopen or during single-pole open conditions, a fault occurs on \nanother phase and causes a trip).\n\nIn most applications, the OPEN command should drive the reclosing relay to \nlockout.

This is because the breaker is open, and the relay is at last \nshot after the settings change, and thus no more automatic reclosures are \navailable.\n\nIf the circuit breaker remains closed through the settings change, the reset \ntimer times out on reset time setting 79RSLD after the settings change and \ngoes to the Reset State (if it is not already in the Reset State), and the shot \ncounter returns to shot = 0. If the relay happens to trip during this reset timing, \nthe relay will immediately go to the Lockout State, because shot = last shot.\n\nDefeat the \nReclosing Relay\n\nIf any one of the following reclosing relay settings are made,\n\n➤ Reclose enable setting E79 = N.\n\n➤ Open Interval 1 time setting 79OI1 = 0.00.\n\nthen the reclosing relay is defeated, and no automatic reclosing can occur. \nThese settings are explained later in this section. See also the SEL-311C \nSettings Sheets.\n\nIf the reclosing relay is defeated, the following also occur.\n\n➤ All three reclosing relay state Relay Word bits (79RS, 79CY, \nand 79LO) are forced to logical 0 (see Table 6.1).\n\n➤ All shot counter Relay Word bits (SH0, SH1, SH2, SH3, and \nSH4) are forced to logical 0 (the shot counter is explained later \nin this section).\n\n➤ The factory-default front-panel LEDs RS and LO are both \nextinguished, providing a visible indication that the recloser is \ndefeated. (This indication is not definitive because these two \nLEDs are also extinguished during a reclose cycle state).\n\n➤ The front-panel Reclosing Relay Shot Counter Screen displays \nNo Reclosing Set. See Functions Unique to the Front-Panel \nInterface on page 11.5.\n\nClose Logic Can Still Operate When the Reclosing Relay Is Defeated\nIf the reclosing relay is defeated, the close logic (see Figure 6.5) can still \noperate if the following settings are not true.\n\n➤ 52A = 0\n\n➤ ULCL = logical 1\n\nMaking 52A = 0 or ULCL = 1 (or setting ULCL to a SELOGIC condition that \nis always logical 1) defeats the close logic and also defeats the reclosing relay.\n\n\n\n6.20\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nClose and Reclose Logic\nReclosing Relay\n\nFor example, if 52A = 52AA * 52AB * 52AC, and the related settings are \nmade as shown in Breaker Status Logic on page 6.2, even if the reclosing has \nbeen defeated, the close logic still operates, allowing closing to take place via \nSELOGIC control equation setting CL (close conditions, other than automatic \nreclosing). See Breaker Status Logic on page 6.2 and Close Logic on page 6.5 \nfor more discussion on SELOGIC control equation settings 52A and CL. Also \nsee Optoisolated Inputs on page 7.1 for more discussion on SELOGIC control \nequation setting 52A.\n\nReclosing Relay \nTimer Settings\n\nThe open interval and reset timer factory settings are shown in Table 6.2.\n\nThe operation of these timers is affected by SELOGIC control equation settings \ndiscussed later in this section. Also, see the SEL-311C Settings Sheets.\n\nOpen Interval Timers\nThe reclose enable setting, E79, determines the number of open interval time \nsettings that can be set. For example, if setting E79 = 3, the first three open \ninterval time settings in Table 6.2 are made available for setting.\n\nIf an open interval time is set to zero, then that open interval time is not \noperable, and neither are the open interval times that follow it.\n\nIn the factory settings in Table 6.2, the open interval 1 time setting 79OI1 is \nthe first open interval time setting set equal to zero.\n\n79OI1 = 0.00 cycles\n\nTherefore, open interval times 79OI1, 79OI2, 79OI3, and 79OI4 are not \noperable. If E79 = 3, and the open interval timer settings were\n\n79OI1 = 180.00 cycles\n\n79OI2 = 0.00 cycles\n\n79OI3 = 900.00 cycles (set to some value other than zero)\nopen interval time 79OI3 would still be inoperative, because a preceding open \ninterval time is set to zero (i.e., 79OI2 = 0.00).\nThe open interval timers time consecutively; they do not have the same \nbeginning time reference point. For example, with settings 79OI1 = 30.00 \ncycles, and 79OI2 = 600.00 cycles, open interval 1 time setting, 79OI1, times \nfirst. If subsequent first reclosure is not successful, then open interval 2 time \nsetting, 79OI2, starts timing. If the subsequent second reclosure is not \nsuccessful, the relay goes to the Lockout State. See the example time line in \nFigure 6.10.

The “last \nshot” value is also equal to the number of reclosures.\n\nIn the example settings above, two set open interval times precede open \ninterval three time, which is set to zero (79OI3 = 0.00).\n\n79OI1 = 30.00\n\n79OI2 = 600.00\n\n79OI3 = 0.00\n\nFor this example:\n\nNumber of reclosures (last shot) = 2 = the number of set open interval \ntimes that precede the first open interval set to zero.\n\nObserve Shot Counter Operation\nObserve the reclosing relay shot counter operation, especially during testing, \nwith the front-panel shot counter screen (accessed via the OTHER pushbutton). \nSee Functions Unique to the Front-Panel Interface on page 11.5.\n\nReset Timer\nReset timers qualify circuit breaker closure before taking the relay to the Reset \nState from the Reclose Cycle State or the Lockout State. Circuit breaker status \nis determined by the SELOGIC control equation setting 52A. (See Breaker \nStatus Logic on page 6.2 for more discussion on SELOGIC control equation \nsetting 52A.)\n\nSetting 79RSD\nQualifies closures when the relay is in the Reclose Cycle State.

These closures are \nusually manual closures. These manual closures can originate external to the \nrelay, via the CLOSE command, or via the SELOGIC control equation setting \nCL (see Figure 6.5).\nSetting 79RSLD is also the reset timer used when the relay powers up, when \nsettings are changed in the active setting group, or the active setting group is \nchanged (see Reclosing Relay States and Settings/Setting Group Changes on \npage 6.19).\nSee Drive-to-Lockout and Drive-to-Last Shot Settings (79DTL and 79DLS, \nRespectively) on page 6.25 for the description of a scenario where there is no \nreset timing via setting 79RSLD to get from the Lockout State to the Reset \nState. In this scenario, the breaker remains closed continuously as the relay \ntransitions (Reset State > Lockout State > Reset State) because of \ndrive-to-lockout setting 79DTL.\n\nSetting 79RSD and Setting 79RSLD Are Independent\nTypically, setting 79RSLD is set less than setting 79RSD. Setting 79RSLD \nemulates reclosing relays with motor-driven timers that have a relatively short \nreset time from the lockout position to the reset position.\n\nThe 79RSD and 79RSLD settings are set independently (setting 79RSLD can \neven be set greater than setting 79RSD, if desired). SELOGIC control equation \nsetting 79BRS (block reset timing) can be set to control reset timing (see \nBlock Reset Timing Setting (79BRS) on page 6.29).\n\nMonitoring Open-Interval and Reset Timing\nOpen-interval and reset timing can be monitored with the following Relay \nWord bits.\n\nIf the open-interval timer is actively timing, OPTMN asserts. When the relay \nis not timing on an open interval (e.g., it is in the Reset State or in the Lockout \nState), OPTMN deasserts. The relay can only time on an open interval when it \nis in the Reclose Cycle State, but just because the relay is in the Reclose Cycle \nState does not necessarily mean the relay is timing on an open interval. When \nthe next open interval is enabled, the relay only times on the open interval \nafter successful reclose initiation, the breaker is open (52A = logical 0), and \nno stall conditions are present (see Skip Shot and Stall Open-Interval Timing \nSettings (79SKP and 79STL, respectively) on page 6.27).\nIf the reset timer is actively timing, RSTMN asserts. If the reset timer is not \ntiming, RSTMN deasserts. See Block Reset Timing Setting (79BRS) on \npage 6.29.\n\nReclosing Relay \nShot Counter\n\nRefer to Figure 6.10.\n\nThe shot counter increments for each reclose operation. For example, when \nthe relay is timing on open interval 1, 79OI1, it is at shot = 0.

The reclose \ninitiate supervision setting 79RIS supervises setting 79RI. When setting 79RI \nsenses a rising edge (logical 0 to logical 1 transition), setting 79RIS has to be \nat logical 1 (79RIS = logical 1) in order for open interval timing to be initiated.\nIf 79RIS = logical 0 when setting 79RI senses a rising edge (logical 0 to \nlogical 1 transition), the relay goes to the Lockout State.\n\nSettings Example\nWith the settings in Table 6.4 set as follows,\n\n79RI = TRIP\n\n79RIS = 52A + 79CY\n\nTable 6.3 Shot Counter Correspondence to Relay Word Bits and Open \nInterval Times\n\nShot\nCorresponding Relay \n\nWord Bit\nCorresponding Open \n\nInterval\n\n0 SH0 79OI1\n\n1 SH1 79OI2\n\n2 SH2 79OI3\n\n3 SH3 79OI4\n\n4 SH4\n\nTable 6.4 Example Reclosing Relay SELOGIC Control Equation Settings\n\nSELOGIC Control \nEquation Setting\n\nExample Setting Definition\n\n79RI TRIP Reclose Initiate\n\n79RIS 52A + 79CY Reclose Initiate Supervision\n\n79DTL OC + !IN105 + LB3 Drive-to-Lockout\n\n79DLS 79LO Drive-to-Last Shot\n\n79SKP 0 Skip Shot\n\n79STL TRIP Stall Open Interval Timing\n\n79BRS TRIP Block Reset Timing\n\n79SEQ 0 Sequence Coordination\n79CLS 1 Reclose Supervision\n\n\n\n6.24\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nClose and Reclose Logic\nReclosing Relay\n\nthe transition of the TRIP Relay Word bit from logical 0 to logical 1 enables the \nnext open-interval only if Relay Word bits 52A or 79CY are logical 1. See \nBreaker Status Logic on page 6.2 for details on configuring SELOGIC setting \n52A for various circuit breaker connections.\n\nThe circuit breaker has to be closed (circuit breaker status 52A = logical 1) at \nthe instant of the first trip of the autoreclose cycle in order for the SEL-311C \nto successfully initiate reclosing and start timing on the first open interval. The \nSEL-311C is not yet in the reclose cycle state (79CY = logical 0) at the instant \nof the first trip.\n\nThen for any subsequent trip operations in the autoreclose cycle, the \nSEL-311C is in the reclose cycle state (79CY = logical 1) and the SEL-311C \nsuccessfully initiates reclosing for each trip. Because of example setting \n79RIS = 52A + 79CY, successful reclose initiation in the reclose cycle state \n(79CY = logical 1) is not dependent on the circuit breaker status (52A). This \nallows successful reclose initiation for the case of an instantaneous trip when \nthe circuit breaker status indication is slow—the instantaneous trip (reclose \ninitiation) occurs before the SEL-311C sees the circuit breaker close.\nIf a flashover occurs in a circuit breaker tank during an open interval (circuit \nbreaker open and the SEL-311C calls for a trip) or, if during single-pole open \nconditions, a fault occurs on another phase and causes a separate trip, the \nSEL-311C goes immediately to lockout.\n\nAdditional Settings Example\nThe preceding settings example initiates open interval timing on rising edge of \nthe TRIP Relay Word bit. The following is an example of reclose initiation on \nthe opening of the circuit breaker.\n\nWith SELOGIC control equation setting 52A configured as described in \nBreaker Status Logic on page 6.2, Relay Word bit 52A indicates the circuit \nbreaker status for the reclosing relay.\n\nWith setting\n79RI = !52A\n\nthe transition of the 52A Relay Word bit from logical 1 to logical 0 (breaker \nopening) enables the next open interval. Setting 79RI looks for a logical 0 to \nlogical 1 transition, thus Relay Word bit 52A is inverted in the 79RI setting \n[!52A = NOT(52A)].\nThe reclose initiate supervision setting 79RIS supervises setting 79RI. With \nsettings\n\n79RI = !52A\n\n79RIS = TRIP\n\nthe transition of the 52A Relay Word bit from logical 1 to logical 0 enables the \nnext open interval only if the TRIP Relay Word bit is at logical 1 (TRIP = \nlogical 1). Thus, the TRIP Relay Word bit has to be asserted when the circuit \nbreaker opens in order to initiate open interval timing. With a long enough \nsetting of the Minimum Trip Duration Timer (TDURD), the TRIP Relay Word \nbit will still be asserted to logical 1 when the circuit breaker opens (see \nFigure 5.1 and Figure 5.4).\n\n\n\n6.25\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nClose and Reclose Logic\nReclosing Relay\n\nIf the TRIP Relay Word bit is at logical 0 (TRIP = logical 0) when the circuit \nbreaker opens (79RI transitions from logical 0 to logical 1), the relay goes to \nthe Lockout State. This helps prevent reclose initiation when the circuit \nbreaker is opened by a signal external to the relay, such as when using the \noptional front-panel SafeLock trip pushbutton, wired similarly to Figure 2.19.\n\nIf circuit breaker status indication (52A) is slow, the TRIP Relay Word bit \nshould be removed from unlatch close setting ULCL (Figure 6.5) when setting \n79RI = !52A. This keeps the SEL-311C from going to lockout prematurely for \nan instantaneous trip after an auto-reclose. This setting allows CLOSE to \nremain asserted until the circuit breaker status indication confirms that the \nbreaker is closed. The circuit breaker anti-pump circuitry should take care of \nthe TRIP and CLOSE being on together for a short period of time.\n\nOther Settings Considerations\n\n1. If no reclose initiate supervision is desired, make the following \nsetting.\n\n79RIS = 1 (numeral 1)\nSetting 79RIS = logical 1 at all times. Any time a logical 0 to \nlogical 1 transition is detected by setting 79RI, the next open \ninterval will be enabled (unless prevented by other means).\n\n2. If the following setting is made,\n79RI = 0 (numeral 0)\n\nreclosing will never take place. The reclosing relay is \neffectively inoperative because there is no way to initiate the \nautoreclose cycle. However, the relay reclose state might still \ntransition between RESET (79RS = 1) and LOCKOUT \n(79LO = 1), depending on 52A status.\n\n3. If the following setting is made,\n79RIS = 0 (numeral 0)\n\nreclosing will never take place (the reclosing relay goes directly \nto the lockout state any time reclosing is initiated). The \nreclosing relay is effectively inoperative.\n\nDrive-to-Lockout and \nDrive-to-Last Shot \nSettings (79DTL and \n79DLS, Respectively) \n\nWhen 79DTL = logical 1, the reclosing relay goes to the Lockout State (Relay \nWord bit 79LO = logical 1), and the factory-default front-panel LO (Lockout) \nLED illuminates.\n\n79DTL has a built-in 60-cycle dropout time. This keeps the drive-to-lockout \ncondition up 60 more cycles after the 79DTL equation has deasserted. This is \nuseful for situations where both of the following are true.\n\n➤ Any of the trip and drive-to-lockout conditions are “pulsed” \nconditions (e.g., the OPEN command Relay Word bit, OC, \nasserts for only 1/4 cycle—refer to Settings Example on \npage 6.26).\n\n➤ Reclose initiation is by the breaker contact opening (e.g., \n79RI = !52A—refer to Additional Settings Example on \npage 6.24).\n\nThen the drive-to-lockout condition overlaps reclose initiation and the \nSEL-311C stays in lockout after the breaker trips open.\n\n\n\n6.26\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nClose and Reclose Logic\nReclosing Relay\n\nIf the relay had previously been in the Reset State (Relay Word bit 79RS = \nlogical 1) with the breaker closed and then a drive-to-lockout condition comes \ntrue (via setting 79DTL), the relay immediately goes to the Lockout State \n(Relay Word bit 79LO = logical 1). If the breaker continues to remain closed \nand then the drive-to-lockout condition (via setting 79DTL) goes away (after \nthe 60-cycle dropout time), the relay then reverts immediately back to the \nReset State. No reset timing via setting 79RSLD is needed to return to the \nReset State in this scenario because the breaker remains closed the entire time. \nThe relay had previously timed on a reset time (setting 79RSD or 79RSLD) \nwhen it first went to the Reset State, before the drive-to-lockout logic (via \nsetting 79DTL) started activating. Thus, there is no need to again reset time \nqualify a breaker that remained closed throughout such a transition (Reset \nState > Lockout State > Reset State), because of drive-to-lockout setting \n79DTL.\n\nWhen 79DLS = logical 1, the reclosing relay goes to the last shot, if the shot \ncounter is not already at a shot value greater than or equal to the calculated last \nshot (see Reclosing Relay Shot Counter on page 6.22).\n\nSettings Example\nThe drive-to-lockout Table 6.4 example setting is as follows.\n\n79DTL = OC + !IN105 + LB3\n\nOptoisolated input IN105 is set to operate as a reclose enable switch (see \nOptoisolated Inputs on page 7.1). When Relay Word bit IN105 = logical 1 \n(reclosing enabled), the relay is not driven to the Lockout State (assuming \nlocal bit LB3 = logical 0, too).\n\n!IN105 = !(logical 1) = NOT(logical 1) = logical 0\n79DTL = OC + !IN105 + LB3 = OC + (logical 0) + LB3 = OC + LB3\n\nWhen Relay Word bit IN105 = logical 0 (reclosing disabled), the relay is \ndriven to the Lockout State.\n\n!IN105 = !(logical 0) = NOT(logical 0) = logical 1\n79DTL = OC + !IN105 + LB3 = OC + (logical 1) + LB3 = logical 1\n\nLocal bit LB3 is set to operate as a manual trip switch (see Local Control \nSwitches on page 7.6 and Trip Logic on page 5.1). When Relay Word bit LB3 \n= logical 0 (no manual trip), the relay is not driven to the Lockout State \n(assuming optoisolated input IN102 = logical 1, too).\n\n79DTL = OC + !IN105 + LB3 = OC + NOT(IN105) + (logical 0) = OC + \nNOT(IN105)\n\nWhen Relay Word bit LB3 = logical 1 (manual trip), the relay is driven to the \nLockout State.\n\n79DTL = OC + !IN105 + LB3 = OC + NOT(IN105) + (logical 1) = logical 1\nRelay Word bit OC asserts for execution of the OPEN command. See the \ndiscussion at the end of Lockout State on page 6.17.\n\nThe drive-to-last shot Table 6.4 example setting is shown below.\n79DLS = 79LO\n\nIf there is one open interval time delay (e.g., setting 79OI1 = 300.00 cycles), \nthe last shot = 1. Any time the relay is in the lockout state (Relay Word bit \n79LO = logical 1), the relay is driven to last shot (if the shot counter is not \nalready at a shot value greater than or equal to shot = 1).\n\n79DLS = 79LO = logical 1\n\n\n\n6.27\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nClose and Reclose Logic\nReclosing Relay\n\nThus, if optoisolated input IN105 (reclose enable switch) is in the “disable \nreclosing” position (Relay Word bit IN105 = logical 0) or local bit LB3 \n(manual trip switch) is operated, then the relay is driven to the Lockout State \n(by setting 79DTL) and, subsequently, last shot (by setting 79DLS).\n\nAdditional Settings Example 1\nThe preceding drive-to-lockout factory settings example drives the relay to the \nLockout State immediately when the reclose enable switch (optoisolated input \nIN105) is put in the “reclosing disabled” position (Relay Word bit IN105 = \nlogical 0).\n\n79DTL = !IN105 + ... = NOT(IN105) + ... = NOT(logical 0) + ... = logical 1\nTo disable reclosing, but not drive the relay to the Lockout State until the relay \ntrips, make settings similar to the following.\n\n79DTL = !IN105 * TRIP + ...\n\nAdditional Settings Example 2\nTo drive the relay to the Lockout State for fault current above a certain level \nwhen tripping (e.g., level of phase instantaneous overcurrent element 50P3), \nmake settings similar to the following.\n\n79DTL = TRIP * 50P3 + ...\n\nAdditionally, if the reclosing relay should go to the Lockout State for an \nunderfrequency trip, make settings similar to the following.\n\n79DTL = TRIP * 81D1T + ...\n\nOther Settings Considerations\nIf no special drive-to-lockout or drive-to-last shot conditions are desired, make \nthe following settings.\n\n79DTL = 0 (numeral 0)\n79DLS = 0 (numeral 0)\n\nWith settings 79DTL and 79DLS inoperative, the relay still goes to the \nLockout State (and to last shot) if an entire automatic reclose sequence is \nunsuccessful.\n\nOverall, settings 79DTL or 79DLS are needed to take the relay to the Lockout \nState (or to last shot) for immediate circumstances.\n\nSkip Shot and Stall \nOpen-Interval Timing \nSettings (79SKP and \n79STL, respectively) \n\nThe skip shot setting 79SKP causes a reclose shot to be skipped. Thus, an \nopen interval time is skipped, and the next open interval time is used instead.\n\nIf 79SKP = logical 1 at the instant of successful reclose initiation (see \npreceding discussion on settings 79RI and 79RIS), the relay increments the \nshot counter to the next shot and then loads the open interval time \ncorresponding to the new shot (see Table 6.3). If the new shot is the “last \nshot,” no open interval timing takes place, and the relay goes to the Lockout \nState if the circuit breaker is open (see Lockout State on page 6.17).\nAfter successful reclose initiation, open interval timing does not start until \nallowed by the stall open interval timing setting 79STL. If 79STL = logical 1, \nopen interval timing is stalled. If 79STL = logical 0, open interval timing can \nproceed.\n\n\n\n6.28\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nClose and Reclose Logic\nReclosing Relay\n\nIf an open interval time has not yet started timing (79STL remains at \nlogical 1), the 79SKP setting is still processed. In such conditions (open \ninterval timing has not yet started), if 79SKP = logical 1, the relay increments \nthe shot counter to the next shot and then loads the open interval time \ncorresponding to the new shot (see Table 6.3). If the new shot turns out to be \nthe “last shot,” no open interval timing takes place, and the relay goes to the \nLockout State if the circuit breaker is open (see Lockout State on page 6.17).\nIf the relay is in the middle of timing on an open interval and 79STL changes \nstate to 79STL = logical 1, open interval timing stops where it is. If 79STL \nchanges state back to 79STL = logical 0, open interval timing resumes where \nit left off. Use the OPTMN Relay Word bit to monitor open interval timing \n(see Monitoring Open-Interval and Reset Timing on page 6.22).\n\nFactory Settings \nExample\n\nThe skip shot function is not enabled in the factory settings.\n79SKP = 0 (numeral 0)\n\nThe stall open interval timing function is not enabled in the factory settings.\n79STL = 0 (numeral 0)\n\nAdditional Settings Example 1\nWith skip shot setting\n\n79SKP = 50P2 * SH0\n\nif shot = 0 (Relay Word bit SH0 = logical 1) and phase current is above the \nphase instantaneous overcurrent element 50P2 threshold (Relay Word bit \n50P2 = logical 1), at the instant of successful reclose initiation, the shot \ncounter is incremented from shot = 0 to shot = 1. Then, open interval 1 time \n(setting 79OI1) is skipped, and the relay times on the open interval 2 time \n(setting 79OI2) instead.\n\nIn Table 6.5, note that the open interval 1 time (setting 79OI1) is a short time, \nwhile the following open interval 2 time (setting 79OI2) is significantly \nlonger. For a high magnitude fault (greater than the phase instantaneous \novercurrent element 50P2 threshold), open interval 1 time is skipped, and \nopen interval timing proceeds on the following open interval 2 time.\n\nOnce the shot is incremented to shot = 1, Relay Word bit SH0 = logical 0 and \nthen setting 79SKP = logical 0, regardless of Relay Word bit 50P2.\n\nAdditional Settings Example 2\nIf the SEL-311C Relay is used on a feeder with a line-side independent power \nproducer (cogenerator), the utility should not reclose into a line still energized \nby an islanded generator. To monitor line voltage and block reclosing, connect \na line-side single-phase potential transformer to channel VS on the SEL-311C \nas shown in Figure 6.11.\n\nTable 6.5 Open Interval Time Example Settings\n\nShot\nCorresponding \nRelay Word Bit\n\nCorresponding \nOpen Interval\n\nOpen Interval \nTime Example \n\nSetting\n\n0 SH0 79OI1  30 cycles\n\n1 SH1 79OI2 600 cycles\n\n\n\n6.29\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nClose and Reclose Logic\nReclosing Relay\n\nFigure 6.11 Reclose Blocking for Islanded Generator\n\nIf the line is energized, channel VS overvoltage element 59S1 can be set to \nassert. Make the following setting.\n\n79STL = 59S1 + ...\n\nIf line voltage is present, Relay Word bit 59S1 asserts, stalling open interval \ntiming (reclose block). If line voltage is not present, Relay Word bit 59S1 \ndeasserts, allowing open interval timing to proceed (unless some other set \ncondition stalls open interval timing).\nThe example connection in Figure 6.11 may only sense voltage on one phase of \nthe line. An alternative connection would place the three-phase potential \ntransformers on the line side of the breaker (connected to VA, VB, VC) and the \nsingle-phase potential transformer on the bus side of the breaker (connected to \nVS). With this alternative connection, the stall open interval timing condition \nwould include all three phases (e.g., 79STL = 59A + 59B + 59C).\n\nAdditional Settings Example 3\nRefer to Figure 6.8 and accompanying setting example, showing an \napplication for setting 79STL.\n\nOther Settings Considerations\nIf no special skip shot or stall open interval timing conditions are desired, \nmake the following settings.\n\n79SKP = 0 (numeral 0)\n79STL = 0 (numeral 0)\n\nBlock Reset Timing \nSetting (79BRS)\n\nThe block reset timing setting 79BRS keeps the reset timer from timing. \nDepending on the reclosing relay state, the reset timer can be loaded with \neither reset time\n\n79RSD (Reset Time from Reclose Cycle)\nor\n\n79RSLD (Reset Time from Lockout)\nDepending on how setting 79BRS is set, none, one, or both of these reset \ntimes can be controlled.

Thus, successful \nreset timing has to be continuous. Use the RSTMN Relay Word bit to monitor \nreset timing (see Monitoring Open-Interval and Reset Timing on page 6.22).\n\nSettings Example\nThe block reset timing example setting is as follows.\n\n79BRS = TRIP \n\nThe block reset timing example setting (79BRS = TRIP) keeps the reset timer \n(setting 79RSD) from starting to time during the brief interval that the circuit \nbreaker is in the process of opening after the trip coil is energized. \n\nAt the instant of reclose initiation (factory reclose initiate setting 79RI = \nTRIP), one of the following starts timing, unless otherwise inhibited.\n\n➤ Reset timing (setting 79RSD) if the circuit breaker is closed\n➤ Open interval timing (setting 79OIn) if the circuit breaker is open\n\nAt the instant of tripping/reclose initiation, the circuit breaker is still closed \nand thus reset timer setting 79RSD starts timing, however briefly, if 79BRS = \nlogical 0. This is mostly a nuisance in the Time column of the event report, \nwhere an “r” appears for a few cycles in the column (indicating the reset timer \nis timing), until the circuit breaker opens. Once the circuit breaker opens, the \nreset timer stops timing. When the circuit breaker recloses later, the reset timer \nstarts timing anew, with full setting value 79RSD.\n\nTRIP remains asserted for at least TDURD time (see Figure 5.4)—long \nenough to encompass this brief time period (waiting for the circuit breaker to \nopen after the trip coil is energized). Thus, setting 79BRS = TRIP is used in \nmost applications.\n\nAdditional Settings Example 1\nThe block reset timing setting is as follows.\n\n79BRS = (51P + 51G) * 79CY\n\nRelay Word bit 79CY corresponds to the Reclose Cycle State. The reclosing \nrelay is in one of the three reclosing relay states at any one time (see \nFigure 6.9 and Table 6.1).\nWhen the relay is in the Reset or Lockout States, Relay Word bit 79CY is \ndeasserted to logical 0. Thus, the 79BRS setting has no effect when the relay \nis in the Reset or Lockout States. When a circuit breaker is closed from \nlockout, there could be cold load inrush current that momentarily picks up a \ntime-overcurrent element (e.g., phase time-overcurrent element 51PT pickup \n(51P) asserts momentarily). But, this assertion of pickup 51P has no effect on \nreset timing because the relay is in the Lockout State (79CY = logical 0). \nThe relay will time immediately on reset time 79RSLD and take the relay \nfrom the Lockout State to the Reset State with no additional delay because \n79BRS is deasserted to logical 0.\n\nWhen the relay is in the Reclose Cycle State, Relay Word bit 79CY is asserted \nto logical 1. Thus, the factory 79BRS setting can function to block reset \ntiming if time-overcurrent pickup 51P or 51G is picked up while the relay is in \n\n\n\n6.31\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nClose and Reclose Logic\nReclosing Relay\n\nthe Reclose Cycle State. This helps prevent repetitive “trip-reclose” cycling \nfor low-magnitude faults where the inverse time-overcurrent tripping time \nmight be greater than the reset time from reclose cycle, 79RSD.\n\nAdditional Settings Example 2\nIf the block reset timing setting is as follows.\n\n79BRS = 51P + 51G\n\nthen reset timing is blocked if time-overcurrent pickup 51P or 51G is picked \nup, regardless of the reclosing relay state.\n\nSequence \nCoordination Setting \n(79SEQ)\n\nThe 79SEQ setting is applicable to distribution applications; for transmission \nsystem applications set 79SEQ = 0.

The preceding pages \ndescribed each of the settings related to the reclosing relay, but did not bring \nthem together for this application. Some of this information is repeated to \nmake the example easier to follow, and some details are not repeated to make \nthe text easier to read.\n\nTo help understand this example, please refer to Section 5: Trip and Target \nLogic for details on the single-pole and three-pole trip logic capabilities of the \nSEL-311C. As with many examples, this is provided as a starting point, and \nnot all required settings have been specified. \n\nShot Counter Operation\nRelay Word bits SH0, SH1, SH2, SH3, and SH4 are important for the \noperation of the reclosing scheme in the SEL-311C. These signals, together \nwith the “reclose initiate” (79RI) and “skip” (79SKP) SELOGIC control \nequation settings, are used to create the SPT and 3PT reclosing logic.\n\nOnce the 79RI (reclose initiate) setting is active, the reclosing relay logic \njumps from 79RS (reset state) to 79CY (cycle state). Within 79CY, there are \nconceptually four other substates, shown in Figure 6.12. \n\n\n\n6.32\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nClose and Reclose Logic\nReclosing Relay\n\nNOTE: The “Substates” shown in \nFigure 6.12 are introduced here for \ndiscussion purposes only. There are \nno Relay Word bits called ST1, ST2, etc.\n\nFigure 6.12 Shot Counter and Substates\n\nRegardless of the state, there is always a path to the lockout state (79LO), \nwhich can be reached because of a failure to close, last shot, or the 79DTL \n(Drive-to-Lockout setting).\nThe 79RI setting starts the reclosing cycle. The open interval will start when \nthe 52A signal (Breaker Status) deasserts.\nThe 79SKP setting is used to transit, incrementing the shot counters, from \nsubstate to substate (ST1 to ST2, for example). The SHx counter bits, and their \ncorresponding values before entering the substate and after issuing the \nsuccessful reclose operation are shown in Figure 6.12.

If the fault is \nstill present when the open pole recloses, there will be a \nthree-phase trip (3PT) and the reclosing relay will be driven to \nlockout.\n\n➤ If a fault develops in the healthy phases during the single-pole \nopen (SPO) condition, the reclosing relay will be forced to \nlockout and the other two phases tripped permanently.\n\n➤ For phase-to-phase and three-phase faults, there will be a \nthree-phase trip (3PT) followed by a reclosure after \n0.5 seconds. This reclose will be supervised by synchronism \ncheck across the open breaker. If the fault is still present when \nthe breaker recloses, there will be a three-phase trip (3PT) and \nthe reclosing relay will be driven to lockout.\n\n➤ The reset time for manual close and reclose cycle completion is \nthe same and equal to two minutes.\n\n➤ During the reset time, the trip is three-phase (3PT) regardless \nof the fault type.\n\nThe example does not cover the settings for the relay at the remote end of the \ntransmission line (not shown). The remote relay would be set to operate in a \nsimilar fashion, with shorter open interval times, and a dead-line check instead \nof a synchronism check during three-pole open conditions. If the remote relay \nwas not the first to reclose after a three-pole trip, the synchronism-check \nfunction in the local relay would never be successful because the line would \nstill be dead. See Synchronism-Check Elements on page 3.53 for additional \ninformation.\n\nBreaker Status Assignment\nThe breaker status inputs should be assigned and the settings should \ncorrespond to the wiring into the relay. For this example, the factory-default \nsettings are used.\n\n52A = 52AA * 52AB * 52AC\n\n52AA = IN101\n\nVS\n\nBus\n\nLine\n\n52AA 52AB 52AC\n\n79\n\n25\n\nVA, VB, VC\n\n\n\n6.34\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nClose and Reclose Logic\nReclosing Relay\n\n52AB = IN102\n\n52AC = IN103\n\nNumber of Shots\nTwo reclosing shots are required: one is used after a single-pole trip and the \nother is used after a three-pole trip. Only one auto-reclosing shot will be \nobserved when the relay is in operation. \n\nE79 = 2\n\nOpen Interval Assignment\nReferring to Figure 6.12, defining the conceptual substates (ST1, ST2, etc.) \nrequires assigning the open interval times (for a 60 Hz nominal power \nsystem).\n\n79OI1 = 60 cycles [= 1.0 second at 60 Hz]\n79OI2 = 30 cycles [= 0.5 seconds at 60 Hz]\n\nReset Time Assignments\nThe reset times from the reclose cycle and from lockout are the same.\n\n79RSD = 7200 cycles [= 2 minutes at 60 Hz]\n79RSLD = 7200 cycles [= 2 minutes at 60 Hz]\n\nDefine the Close Failure Time\nAssume that the breaker requires three cycles to close, then add a margin to \nthe expected closing time. An example is shown below.\n\nCFD = 5 cycles\n\nDefine the Trip During Open Pole Time Delay\nThe Trip During Open-Pole Delay setting TOPD is shown in Figure 5.3. \nWhen the TOP Relay Word bit is included in the E3PT setting, this timer \nprovides a window after a single-pole trip (SPT) during which any new trip is \nconverted into a three-pole trip (3PT). In this example, make the TOPD setting \nthe same as the reclose open interval for SPT conditions.\n\nThis example also uses TOP in the 79DTL setting.\n\nGroup settings\n      TOPD = 60 cycles [same as 79OI1]\n\nDefine the Phase Discordance Time Delay\nThe phase discordance timer limits the amount of time the breaker remains in \na single-pole open condition. This timer must be set to a longer time delay \nthan the greatest open interval time, plus a margin. In this example, if the SPO \ncondition persists for longer than 2 seconds, the relay issues a three-pole trip \n(3PT) and drives the reclosing relay to lockout.\nThese settings use SELOGIC timer SV3T with pickup setting SV3PU.\n\nLogic settings\nSV3 = SPO\n\nTR = ... + SV3T\n\nE3PT = ... + SV3T\n\n79DTL = ... + SV3T\n\n\n\n6.35\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nClose and Reclose Logic\nReclosing Relay\n\nGroup settings\nSV3PU = 120.00 cycles (= 2 s at 60 Hz)\nSV3DO = 0.00 cycles\n\nDefine the Reclose Supervision Failure Time\nFor the 3PT reclosing cycle, the synchronism-check function (25) will \nsupervise the reclosing relay as shown in the Figure 6.13. In this example, if \nthe open interval times out and the synchronism-check (25) condition has not \nasserted within 2 cycles, the reclosing relay will go to lockout.\n\n79CLSD = 2 cycles\n\nReclose Initiate Conditions\nThe reclose initiate cycle will be started when the relay trips. The reclose \ninitiate logic responds to the rising edge of the 79RI equation. This example \nrequires no reclose initiate supervision.\n\n79RI = TRIP\n\n79RIS = 1\n\nDrive-to-Lockout Conditions\nThere are several conditions that are typically used to send the reclosing relay \nto lockout. In this application, they are as follows.\n\n1. Manual trip issued via SELOGIC control equation setting \nBKMTR.\n\n2. Trip of any time delayed protective function.\n\n3. A TRIP occurs while in Substate 1, after a single-pole trip \n(SPT) operation. In this settings example, the relay asserts TOP \nfor 60 cycles, matching the 79OI1 setting. This condition sends \nthe reclosing relay to lockout for any new trip after a \nsingle-pole trip.\n\n4. Any trip occurs during an automatic reclose attempt following \na single-pole trip.\n\n5. Failure to close.\n\n6. Reclose enable condition not asserted (for example, LT2 = \nlogical 0) and the breaker is open.\n\n7. A single-pole open condition (SPO) exceeds the phase \ndiscordance timer setting.\n\n8. Failure in the reclose supervision check.\n\nExample drive-to lockout-setting.\n79DTL = BKMTR + (M2PT + Z2GT + 51PT + ... ) + (TRIP * TOP) + (TRIP*LT10) + \n\nCF + (!LT2 * !52A) + SV3T\n\nFor drive-to-lockout condition #4, above, a latching relay (LT10) is \nprogrammed to assert when a CLOSE operation occurs in the reclose cycle \nstate (79CY) after a single-pole trip (SH0 to SH1 transition). SH1 must be \nused in this expression because of the processing order of the equations. The \n79RS state clears the latch.\n\nSET10 = CLOSE * 79CY * SH1\n\nRST10 = 79RS\n\nNOTE: The failure in reclose \nsupervision case is built into the \nreclosing relay and does not need to \nbe included in the 79DTL setting. See \nthe bottom of Figure 6.6.\n\n\n\n6.36\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nClose and Reclose Logic\nReclosing Relay\n\nReclosing Relay State Transition\nFrom the 79RS (reset) state, the reclosing relay enters the 79CY (cycle) state \nand is initially in substate ST1. The first substate is assigned to the single-pole \ntrip (SPT) cycle. The second substate is assigned to the three-pole trip (3PT) \ncycle. If there is a SPT, then the substate is correct and the reclose initiation \nwill cause the 79OI1 open interval time setting to be used. When the open \ninterval timer times out, the relay will issue a CLOSE because 79CLS will be \nasserted (see Reclose Supervision on page 6.36) and will move to Shot 1 \n(SH1 = logical 1). \nHowever, if there is a 3PT, there is a need to jump to the next substate. The \n“skip shot” equation is used for this purpose. \n\n79SKP = 3PT * SH0\n\nAs shown in Figure 6.10, from the 79RS state the shot counter will be at SH0 \nwhen the first reclose initiate condition occurs. If a 3PT is present, the 79SKP \nexpression will assert, the reclosing relay will immediately advance the shot \ncounter to SH1, and the 79OI2 open interval time setting will be used. When \nthe open interval timer times-out, the relay will issue the CLOSE if 79CLS is \nasserted and will move to shot 2 (SH2 = logical 1). \nFor phase-to-ground faults, the relay asserts SPT and the 79SKP equation will \nnot assert for the first trip. The SH0 term in the 79SKP expression deasserts as \nsoon as the shot counter is changed, preventing any further shots from being \nskipped.\n\nThe skip-shot setting is only used in this example for moving from SH0 to \nSH1 (for a three-phase trip). The drive-to-lockout setting 79DTL prevents any \nsubsequent auto-reclose attempts from occurring.\n\nReclose Supervision\nThe 3PT reclose will use the synchronism-check function to allow the \nreclosing relay to send the CLOSE command. The SPT reclose cycle does not \nneed supervision. Including SH0 in the 79CLS supervision equation allows \nthe reclose from SPT to occur.\n\n79CLS = SH0 + 25A1 * SH1\n\nNonapplicable Setting Equations\nThe reclosing relay has a few other settings that are not used in this example.\n\n1. Drive to Last Shot (79DLS).\n79DLS = 0\n\n2. Stall Open Interval Timing freezes the open interval timer.\n79STL = 0\n\n3. Block Reset Timing freezes the reset interval timer. This can be \nuseful if an input coming from the breaker indicates that the \nbreaker is not yet ready, for example.\n\n79BRS = 0\n\n4. Sequence coordination is used mainly in distribution networks \nto coordinate reclosing counts of upstream devices.\n\n79SEQ = 0\n\nRequired E3PT Setting\nThe operation of the reclosing relay in the SEL-311C and the single-pole trip \nlogic need to be coordinated. When enabled by the trip-related settings (see \nSingle-Pole Tripping on page 5.2), the trip logic in the SEL-311C will send \n\n\n\n6.37\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nClose and Reclose Logic\nReclosing Relay\n\nthe single-pole trip (SPT) signal for ground faults, unless forced to perform a \nthree-phase trip by the E3PT setting.\n\nIt is necessary to force the 3PT under certain conditions, for example,\n\n➤ When the reclosing relay is in the lockout state.\n\n➤ When the breaker is open (after a single-pole trip) and the \nreclosing relay open interval timer is timing. Relay Word bit \nTOP remains asserted for TOPD cycles. In this example, \nTOPD is set the same as the first open interval time setting \n79OI1.\n\n➤ When the reclosing relay is in Shot 2.\n\n➤ When the reclose enable latch LT2 is deasserted. This causes \nany trip to be a three-pole trip when reclosing is defeated.\n\n➤ When the phase discordance timer has timed-out.\n\nOther conditions may be needed. The conditions above will be used as an \nexample.\n\nE3PT = 79LO + TOP + SH2 + !LT2 + SV3T\n\nIn cases where the fault is a permanent single line-to-ground fault, the 79LO \nterm asserts and causes the resulting trip after reclosure to be three-pole \n(3PT). This ensures the breaker three-pole open (3PO) condition whenever the \nreclosing relay enters the lockout state.\n\nExternal Signals\nMost likely the reclosing scheme will require information from other \nprotective relays in the bay. For example, backup protection, breaker failure \nrelays, or transfer trip schemes could send initiation and/or blocking signals to \nthe reclosing relay. \n\nWhen incorporating external devices in the reclosing scheme, care should be \ntaken to provide the SEL-311C similar inputs (via optoisolated inputs, \nMIRRORED BITS, or IEC 61850 GOOSE messages) with the same meaning as \nthe internal ones described in the discussion above.\n\nFor example, if IN105 is an external reclose initiation signal, it should have \nthe same meaning as the TRIP bit used in the example. \n\n79RI = TRIP + IN105\n\n\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nSection 7\nR.Instruction Manual\n\nInputs, Outputs, Timers, \nand Other Control Logic\n\nOverview\nThis section contains the following topics:\n\n➤ Optoisolated Inputs\n\n➤ Local Control Switches on page 7.6\n\n➤ Remote Control Switches on page 7.10\n\n➤ Latch Control Switches on page 7.11\n\n➤ Multiple Setting Groups on page 7.17\n\n➤ SELOGIC Control Equation Variables/Timers on page 7.26\n\n➤ Logic Variables on page 7.31\n\n➤ Virtual Bits on page 7.33\n\n➤ Output Contacts on page 7.33\n\n➤ Rotating Display on page 7.38\n\nThis section explains the settings and operation of all the programmable logic \nfunctions of the relay, including control input and output functions.

These timers are IN101D–IN106D (see Figure 7.1) for the main board, \nIN201D–IN208D for extra I/O board Options 2, 5, and 6, and IN201D–IN216D for \nextra I/O board Option 4. The setting is applied to both the pickup and dropout time \nfor the corresponding input.\n\nDebounce timer settings are adjustable from 0.00 to 2.00 cycles, or AC. The \nrelay takes the entered time setting and internally runs the timer at the nearest \n1/16 cycle. For example, if setting IN105D = 0.80, internally the timer runs at \nthe nearest 1/16 cycle: 13/16 cycles (13/16 = 0.8125).\nFor most dc applications, the input pickup/dropout debounce timers should be \nset in 1/4 cycle increments.\n\nOnly a few applications (e.g., communications-assisted tripping schemes) \nmight require input pickup/dropout debounce timers set less than 1/4 cycle \n[e.g., if setting IN105D = 0.13, internally the timer runs at the nearest\n1/16 cycle: 2/16 cycles (2/16 = 0.1250)].\nRelay Word bits IN101–IN106 and IN201–IN216 are updated on the next \n1/4-cycle processing interval after the debounce timer expires.\n\nIf more than two cycles of debounce is needed, run the Relay Word bit (for \nexample, IN101) through a SELOGIC control equation variable timer and use \nthe output of the timer for input functions (see Figure 7.24 and Figure 7.25).\nThe AC setting allows the input to sense ac control signals. When you use the AC \nsetting, the input has a maximum pickup time of 0.75 cycles and a maximum \ndropout time of 1.25 cycles. The AC setting qualifies the input by not asserting until \ntwo successive 1/16 cycle samples are higher than the optoisolated input voltage \nthreshold and not deasserting until sixteen successive 1/16 cycle samples are lower \nthan the optoisolated input voltage threshold.\n\nSee SEL Application Guide AG2003-08, Guidelines for Using Optoisolated \nInputs in SEL Relays on the SEL website for more information about \ndebounce timers and optoisolated input security.\n\nView Raw \nInput Status\n\nFor system testing and analysis, the status of the IN101–IN106 and IN201–IN216 \ninputs before the debounce timer is applied can be viewed in an event report \nby using the EVE R or CEV R commands. This type of event report is helpful \nfor analyzing contact bounce problems with connected equipment. See \nFiltered and Unfiltered Event Reports on page 12.17 for more information.\n\nInput Functions Optoisolated inputs are used by including the corresponding Relay Word bits (for example, IN101 or IN102) in SELOGIC control equations.\n\nFactory Settings \nExamples\n\nFigure 7.3 Circuit Breaker Auxiliary Contacts and Received Permissive Trip \nContact Connected to Optoisolated Inputs IN101–IN104\n\nThe functions for inputs IN101–IN104 are described in the following \ndiscussions.\n\nPermissive Trip\nSignal (RX)52a\n\nC-Phase\n\nSEL-311C\n\n(+)\n\nIN104\n\n(—)\n\nIN103\n\n52a\n\nB-Phase\n\nIN102\n\n52a\n\nA-Phase\n\nIN101\n\n\n\n7.4\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nInputs, Outputs, Timers, and Other Control Logic\nOptoisolated Inputs\n\nInputs IN101–IN103\nRelay Word bits IN101–IN103 are used in the factory settings for the \nSELOGIC control equation circuit breaker status settings.\n\n52AA = IN101\n\n52AB = IN102\n\n52AC = IN103\n\nConnect inputs IN101–IN103 to the 52a circuit breaker auxiliary contacts, as \nshown in Figure 7.3.\n\nIf 52b circuit breaker auxiliary contacts are connected instead of 52a auxiliary \ncontacts, the settings must be changed to the following.\n\n52AA = !IN101 [!IN101 = NOT(IN101)]\n52AB = !IN102 [!IN102 = NOT(IN102)]\n52AC = !IN103 [!IN103 = NOT(IN103)]\n\nSee Breaker Status Logic on page 6.2 for more information on SELOGIC \ncontrol equation settings 52AA, 52AB, and 52AC.\n\n\n\n7.5\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nInputs, Outputs, Timers, and Other Control Logic\nOptoisolated Inputs\n\nIt is recommended that the pickup/dropout timers for inputs IN101–IN103 be set \nas follows.\n\nIN101D = 0.50 cycles\n\nIN102D = 0.50 cycles\n\nIN103D = 0.50 cycles\n\nThese settings provide input energization/de-energization debounce, and may \nbe adjusted to suit the application.\nInputs IN101–IN103 are indirectly used via the 52AA, 52AB, and 52AC \nRelay Word bits for other purposes. For example, the SEL-311C pole open \nlogic may use the breaker status inputs as part of the single-pole open (SPO) \nor three-pole open (3PO) determination (see Pole-Open Logic on page 5.18).\nThe relay also requires a three-phase status Relay Word bit called 52A, that is \nprogrammable via SELOGIC control equation 52A.

Operate the sixteen (16) local control \nswitches using the CNTRL pushbutton on the front-panel keyboard/display \n(see Section 11: Front-Panel Interface).\n\nFigure 7.4 Local Control Switches Drive Local Bits LB1 Through LB16\n\nThe output of the local control switch in Figure 7.4 is a Relay Word bit LBn \n(n = 1 through 16), called a local bit. The local control switch logic in \nFigure 7.4 repeats for each local bit LB1–LB16. Use these local bits in \nSELOGIC control equations. \n\nFor a given local control switch, the local control switch positions are enabled \nby making corresponding label settings. Pressing the CNTRL button on the front \npanel displays a menu of local control switch functions. Follow the display \nmenu to operate (set, pulse, or clear) the local bit associated with desired local \ncontrol switch.

Local \ncontrol switches configured as ON/OFF switches can be used for applications \nsuch as those listed below.\n\n➤ Reclosing relay enable/disable\n\n➤ Ground relay enable/disable\n\n➤ Remote control supervision\n\nLocal control switches can also be configured as ON/OFF/MOMENTARY \nswitches for applications that require such. Local control switches can be \napplied to almost any control scheme that traditionally requires front-panel \nswitches.\n\nLocal Control Switch \nStates Retained\n\nPower Loss\nThe states of the local bits (Relay Word bits LB1–LB16) are retained if power \nto the relay is lost and then restored. If a local control switch is in the ON \nposition (corresponding local bit is asserted to logical 1) when power is lost, it \ncomes back in the ON position (corresponding local bit is still asserted to \nlogical 1) when power is restored. If a local control switch is in the OFF \nposition (corresponding local bit is deasserted to logical 0) when power is lost, \nit comes back in the OFF position (corresponding local bit is still deasserted to \nlogical 0) when power is restored. This feature makes local bits behave the \nsame as a traditional installation with panel-mounted control switches. If \npower is lost to the panel, the front-panel control switch positions remain \nunchanged.\n\nIf a local bit is routed to a programmable output contact and control power is \nlost, the state of the local bit is stored in nonvolatile memory but the output \ncontact will go to its de-energized state. When the control power is reapplied \nto the relay, the programmed output contact will go back to the state of the \nlocal bit after relay initialization.\n\nSettings Change or Active Setting Group Change\nIf settings are changed (for the active setting group or one of the other setting \ngroups) or the active setting group is changed, the states of the local bits \n(Relay Word bits LB1–LB16) are retained, much like in the preceding Power \nLoss on page 7.9 explanation.\n\nLogical 1 LB4\n\nMANUAL CLOSE\n\nRETURN\n(Logical 0)\n\nCLOSE\n\nLocal\nBit\n\n\n\n7.10\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nInputs, Outputs, Timers, and Other Control Logic\nRemote Control Switches\n\nIf a local control switch is made inoperable because of a settings change (i.e., \nthe corresponding label settings are nulled), the corresponding local bit is then \nfixed at logical 0, regardless of the local bit state before the settings change. If \na local control switch is made newly operable because of a settings change \n(i.e., the corresponding label settings are set), the corresponding local bit starts \nout at logical 0.\n\nRemote Control Switches\nRemote control switches are operated via the communications ports (see CON \nCommand (Control Remote Bit) on page 10.40), Appendix J: Configuration, \nFast Meter, and Fast Operate Commands, Appendix L: DNP3 \nCommunications, Appendix O: Modbus RTU and TCP Communications, and \nAppendix P: IEC 61850).\n\nFigure 7.10 Remote Control Switches Drive Remote Bits RB1–RB32\n\nThe outputs of the remote control switches in Figure 7.10 are Relay Word bits \nRBn (n = 1 to 32), called remote bits. Use these remote bits in SELOGIC \ncontrol equations.\n\nAny given remote control switch can be put in one of the following three \npositions.\n\nON (logical 1)\nOFF (logical 0)\nMOMENTARY (logical 1 for one processing interval)\n\nRemote Bit \nApplication Ideas\n\nWith SELOGIC control equations, the remote bits can be used in applications \nsimilar to those that local bits are used in (see preceding local control switch \ndiscussion).\nAlso, remote bits can be used much as optoisolated inputs are used in \noperating latch control switches (see discussion following Figure 7.15). Pulse \n(momentarily operate) the remote bits for this application.\n\nRemote Bit States \nNot Retained When \nPower Is Lost\n\nThe states of the remote bits (Relay Word bits RB1–RB32) are not retained if \npower to the relay is lost and then restored. The remote control switches \nalways come back in the OFF position (corresponding remote bit is deasserted \nto logical 0) when power is restored to the relay.\n\nLogical 1 RBn\n(n = 1 through 32)\n\nON Position\n(Maintained Logical 1 Position)\n\nOFF Position\n(Maintained Logical 0 Position)\n\nMOMENTARY Position \n(Logical 1 for One Processing Interval)\n\nRelay\nWord\nBit\n\n\n\n7.11\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nInputs, Outputs, Timers, and Other Control Logic\nLatch Control Switches\n\nRemote Bit States \nRetained When \nSettings Changed or \nActive Setting Group \nChanged\n\nThe state of each remote bit is retained if relay settings are changed (for the \nactive setting group or one of the other setting groups) or the active setting \ngroup is changed. If a remote control switch is in the ON position \n(corresponding remote bit is asserted to logical 1) before a setting change or \nan active setting group change, it comes back in the ON position \n(corresponding remote bit is still asserted to logical 1) after the change. If a \nremote control switch is in the OFF position (corresponding remote bit is \ndeasserted to logical 0) before a settings change or an active setting group \nchange, it comes back in the OFF position (corresponding remote bit is still \ndeasserted to logical 0) after the change.\n\nDetails on the \nRemote Control \nSwitch MOMENTARY \nPosition\n\nThis subsection describes remote control switch 3, which is also called remote \nbit 3 (RB3). All of the remote bits, RB1–RB32, operate in the same way.\nSee CON Command (Control Remote Bit) on page 10.40.\nThe CON 3 command and PRB 3 subcommand place the remote control \nswitch 3 into the MOMENTARY position for one processing interval, \nregardless of its initial state. Remote control switch 3 is then placed in the \nOFF position.\n\nIf RB3 is initially at logical 0, pulsing it with the CON 3 command and PRB 3 \nsubcommand will change RB3 to a logical 1 for one processing interval, and \nthen return it to a logical 0. In this situation, the /RB3 (rising-edge operator) \nwill also assert for one processing interval, followed by the \\RB3 (falling-edge \noperator) one processing interval later.\nIf RB3 is initially at logical 1 instead, pulsing it with the CON 3 command \nand PRB 3 subcommand will change RB3 to a logical 0. In this situation, the \n/RB3 (rising-edge operator) will not assert, but the \\RB3 (falling-edge \noperator) will assert for one processing interval.\nSee Appendix F: Setting SELOGIC Control Equations for more details on using \nthe rising- and falling-edge operators in SELOGIC control equations.\n\nLatch Control Switches\nThe latch control switch feature of this relay replaces latching relays. \nTraditional latching relays maintain their output contact state when set.\n\nThe state of a traditional latching relay output contact is changed by pulsing \nthe latching relay inputs (see Figure 7.11). Pulse the set input to close (“set”) \nthe latching relay output contact. Pulse the reset input to open (“reset”) the \nlatching relay output contact. Often the external contacts wired to the latching \nrelay inputs are from remote control equipment (e.g., SCADA, RTU).\n\nFigure 7.11 Traditional Latching Relay\n\nNOTE: The SEL-311C model described \nin this manual does not include an \nELAT setting.

The latch control switch logic in \nFigure 7.12 repeats for each latch bit LT1–LT16. Use these latch bits in \nSELOGIC control equations.\n\nThese latch control switches each have the following SELOGIC control \nequation settings.\n\nSETn (set latch bit LTn to logical 1)\nRSTn (reset latch bit LTn to logical 0)\n\nIf setting SETn asserts to logical 1, latch bit LTn asserts to logical 1. If setting \nRSTn asserts to logical 1, latch bit LTn deasserts to logical 0. If both settings \nSETn and RSTn assert to logical 1, setting RSTn has priority and latch bit LTn \ndeasserts to logical 0.\n\nLatch Control Switch \nApplication Ideas\n\nLatch control switches can be used for such applications as the following.\n\n➤ Reclosing relay enable/disable\n\n➤ Ground relay enable/disable\n\nLatch control switches can be applied to almost any control scheme. The \nfollowing is an example of using a latch control switch to enable/disable the \nreclosing relay in the SEL-311C.\n\nReclosing Relay \nEnable/Disable \nSetting Example\n\nUse a latch control switch to enable/disable the reclosing relay in the \nSEL-311C. In this example, a SCADA contact is connected to optoisolated \ninput IN204. Each pulse of the SCADA contact changes the state of the \nreclosing relay. The SCADA contact is not maintained, just pulsed to \nenable/disable the reclosing relay.\n\nFigure 7.13 SCADA Contact Pulses Input IN204 to Enable/Disable Reclosing \nRelay\n\nIf the reclosing relay is enabled and the SCADA contact is pulsed, the \nreclosing relay is then disabled. If the SCADA contact is pulsed again, the \nreclosing relay is enabled again. The control operates in a cyclic manner as \nshown below.\n\npulse to enable ... pulse to disable ... pulse to enable ... pulse to disable ...\n\nLTnSETn\n\nRSTn\n\n(Set)\n\n(Reset)\n(n = 1 through 16)\n\nRelay\nWord\nBits\n\nSELOGIC\nSetting\n\n(+)\n\nSCADA\n\n(—)\n\nEnable/Disable Reclosing Relay\n\nSEL-311C\n\nIN204\n\n\n\n7.13\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nInputs, Outputs, Timers, and Other Control Logic\nLatch Control Switches\n\nThis reclosing relay logic is implemented in the following SELOGIC control \nequation settings and displayed in Figure 7.14.\n\nSET1 = /IN204 * !LT1 [= (rising edge of input IN204) AND NOT(LT1)]\nRST1 = /IN204 * LT1 [= (rising edge of input IN204) AND LT1]\n79DTL = !LT1 [= NOT(LT1); drive-to-lockout setting]\n\nFigure 7.14 Latch Control Switch Controlled by a Single Input to \nEnable/Disable Reclosing\n\nFeedback Control\nNote in Figure 7.14 that the latch control switch output (latch bit LT1) is \neffectively used as feedback for SELOGIC control equation settings SET1 and \nRST1. The feedback of latch bit LT1 “guides” input IN204 to the correct latch \ncontrol switch input.\n\nIf latch bit LT1 = logical 0, input IN204 is routed to setting SET1 (set latch bit \nLT1).\n\nSET1 = /IN204 * !LT1 = /IN204 * NOT(LT1) = /IN204 * NOT(logical 0) = \n/IN204 = rising edge of input IN204\n\nRST1 = /IN204 * LT1 = /IN204 * (logical 0) = logical 0\nIf latch bit LT1 = logical 1, input IN204 is routed to setting RST1 (reset latch \nbit LT1).\n\nSET1 = /IN204 * !LT1 = /IN204 * NOT(LT1) = /IN204 * NOT(logical 1) = \n/IN204 * (logical 0) = logical 0\n\nRST1 = /IN204 * LT1 = /IN204 * (logical 1) = /IN204 = rising edge of input \nIN204\n\nRising-Edge Operators\nRefer to Figure 7.14 and Figure 7.15.\n\nThe rising-edge operator in front of Relay Word bit IN204 (/IN204) sees a \nlogical 0 to logical 1 transition as a “rising edge,” and /IN204 asserts to \nlogical 1 for one processing interval. For more details on rising-edge \noperators, see Appendix F: Setting SELOGIC Control Equations.\n\nThe rising-edge operator on input IN204 is necessary because any single \nassertion of optoisolated input IN204 by the SCADA contact will last for at \nleast a few cycles, and each individual assertion of input IN204 should only \nchange the state of the latch control switch once (e.g., latch bit LT1 changes \nstate from logical 0 to logical 1).\n\nLT1\n\nIN204\n\n(Set)\n\n(Reset)\n\nRising-Edge\nDetect\n\nSET1\n\nRST1\n\nSELOGIC\nSetting\n\nSELOGIC\nSetting\n\nRelay\nWord\nBit\n\nRelay\nWord\nBit\n\n\n\n7.14\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nInputs, Outputs, Timers, and Other Control Logic\nLatch Control Switches\n\nFor example in Figure 7.14, if\n\nLT1 = logical 0\n\ninput IN204 is routed to setting SET1 (as discussed previously).\nSET1 = /IN204 = rising edge of input IN204\n\nIf input IN204 is then asserted for a few cycles by the SCADA contact (see \nPulse 1 in Figure 7.15), SET1 is asserted to logical 1 for one processing \ninterval. This causes latch bit LT1 to change state in the next processing \ninterval.\n\nLT1 = logical 1\n\nWith latch bit LT1 now at logical 1 for the next processing interval, input \nIN204 is routed to setting RST1 (as discussed previously).\n\nRST1 = /IN204 = rising edge of input IN204\n\nThis would then appear to enable the “reset” input (setting RST1) the next \nprocessing interval. But the “rising-edge” condition occurred the preceding \nprocessing interval. /IN204 is now at logical 0, so setting RST1 does not \nassert, even though input IN204 remains asserted for at least a few cycles by \nthe SCADA contact.\n\nIf the SCADA contact deasserts and then asserts again (new rising edge—see \nPulse 2 in Figure 7.15), the “reset” input (setting RST1) asserts and latch bit \nLT1 deasserts back to logical 0 again. Thus, each individual assertion of input \nIN204 (Pulse 1, Pulse 2, Pulse 3, and Pulse 4 in Figure 7.15) changes the state \nof latch control switch just once.\n\nFigure 7.15 Latch Control Switch Operation Time Line\n\nUse a Remote Bit Instead to Enable/Disable the Reclosing Relay\nUse a remote bit to enable/disable the reclosing relay, instead of an \noptoisolated input. For example, substitute remote bit RB1 for optoisolated \ninput IN204 in the settings accompanying Figure 7.14.\n\nSET1 = /RB1 * !LT1 [= (rising edge of remote bit RB1) AND NOT(LT1)]\nRST1 = /RB1 * LT1 [= (rising edge of remote bit RB1) AND LT1]\n79DTL = !LT1 [= NOT(LT1); drive-to-lockout setting]\n\nNOTE: Refer to Optoisolated Inputs \non page 7.1 and Figure 7.1. Relay Word \nbit IN204 shows the state of \noptoisolated input IN204 after the input \npickup/dropout debounce timer \nIN204D. Thus, when using Relay Word \nbit IN204 in Figure 7.13 and Figure 7.14 \nand associated SELOGIC control \nequations, keep in mind any time \ndelay produced by the input \npickup/dropout debounce timer. \n\nRST1 = /IN204 * LT1\n\n/IN204\n\nIN204\n\nSET1 = /IN204 * !LT1\n\nRising\nEdge\n\nOne\nProcessing\nInterval\n\nPulse 1 Pulse 2 Pulse 3 Pulse 4\n\nRising\nEdge\n\nRising\nEdge\n\nRising\nEdge\n\nLT1\n\n\n\n7.15\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nInputs, Outputs, Timers, and Other Control Logic\nLatch Control Switches\n\nPulse remote bit RB1 to enable reclosing, pulse remote bit RB1 to disable \nreclosing, etc.—much like the operation of optoisolated input IN204 in the \nprevious example. Remote bits (Relay Word bits RB1–RB32) are operated \nthrough the serial port. See Remote Control Switches on page 7.10 for more \ninformation on remote bits.\n\nThese are just a few control logic examples—many variations are possible.\n\nLatch Control Switch States Retained\nPower Loss\n\nThe states of the latch bits (LT1–LT16) are retained if power to the relay is lost \nand then restored. If a latch bit is asserted (e.g., LT2 = logical 1) when power \nis lost, it comes back asserted (LT2 = logical 1) when power is restored. If a \nlatch bit is deasserted (e.g., LT3 = logical 0) when power is lost, it comes back \ndeasserted (LT3 = logical 0) when power is restored. This feature makes the \nlatch bits behave the same as traditional latching relays. In a traditional \ninstallation, if power is lost to the panel, the latching relay output contact \nposition remains unchanged.\n\nSettings Change or Active Setting Group Change\nIf individual settings are changed (for the active setting group or one of the \nother setting groups) or the active setting group is changed, the states of the \nlatch bits (Relay Word bits LT1–LT16) are retained, much like in the \npreceding Power Loss on page 7.15 explanation.\n\nIf the individual settings change or active setting group change causes a \nchange in SELOGIC control equation settings SETn or RSTn (n = 1 through \n16), the retained states of the latch bits can be changed, subject to the newly \nenabled settings SETn or RSTn.\n\nReset Latch Bits for \nActive Setting Group \nChange\n\nIf desired, the latch bits can be reset to logical 0 right after a settings group \nchange, using SELOGIC control equation setting RSTn (n = 1 through 16). \nRelay Word bits SG1–SG6 indicate the active setting Group 1 through 6, \nrespectively (see Table 7.3).\nFor example, an application requires that when setting Group 4 becomes the \nactive setting group, latch bit LT2 gets reset. Make the following SELOGIC \ncontrol equation settings in setting Group 4.\n\nRST2 = /SG4 + ... [other logic]\n\nFigure 7.16 Time Line for Reset of Latch Bit LT2 After Active Setting Group \nChange\n\nNOTE: If a latch bit is set to a \nprogrammable output contact (e.g., \nOUT103 = LT2) and power to the relay \nis lost, the state of the latch bit is \nstored in nonvolatile memory but the \noutput contact will go to its \nde-energized state. When power to the \nrelay is restored, the programmable \noutput contact will go back to the \nstate of the latch bit after relay \ninitialization.\n\nSG4\n\nRST2 = /SG4 + ...\n\nLT2\n\nSetting Group 4 Activated\n\nLatch Bit LT2\nReset to Logical 0\n\none processing interval\n\none processing interval\n\n\n\n7.16\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nInputs, Outputs, Timers, and Other Control Logic\nLatch Control Switches\n\nIn Figure 7.16, the rising edge operator /SG4 creates a pulse (logical 1) for one \nquarter cycle after setting group 4 is newly entered. Latch bit LT2 is reset (deasserted \nto logical 0) when setting RST2 briefly asserts to logical 1 right after setting Group 4 \nis activated. This logic only clears LT2 after a setting group change from another \ngroup to Group 4—it does not clear the latch when the relay is powered-up into \nsetting Group 4. This logic can be repeated for other latch bits.\n\nNote: Make Latch \nControl Switch \nSettings With Care\n\nThe latch bit states are stored in nonvolatile memory so they can be retained \nduring power loss, settings change, or active setting group change. The \nnonvolatile memory is rated for a finite number of “writes” for all cumulative \nlatch bit state changes. Exceeding the limit can result in an eventual self-test \nfailure. An average of 70 cumulative latch bit state changes per day can be \nmade for a 25-year relay service life.\nThis requires that SELOGIC control equation settings SETn and RSTn for any \ngiven latch bit LTn (n = 1 through 16) be set with care. Settings SETn and \nRSTn cannot result in continuous cyclical operation of latch bit LTn. Use \ntimers to qualify conditions set in settings SETn and RSTn. If any optoisolated \ninputs IN101–IN106 or IN201–IN216 are used in settings SETn and RSTn, the \ninputs have their own debounce timer that can help in providing the necessary \ntime qualification (see Figure 7.1 and Figure 7.2).\nIn the preceding reclosing relay enable/disable example application \n(Figure 7.14 and Figure 7.15), the SCADA contact cannot be \nasserting/deasserting continuously, thus causing latch bit LT1 to change state \ncontinuously. Note that the rising-edge operators in the SET1 and RST1 \nsettings keep latch bit LT1 from cyclically operating for any single assertion \nof the SCADA contact.\n\nAnother variation to the example application in Figure 7.14 and Figure 7.15 \nthat adds more security is a timer with pickup/dropout times set the same (see \nFigure 7.17 and Figure 7.18). Suppose that SV6PU and SV6DO are both set \nto 300 cycles.

Corresponding \nRelay Word bit SG3 is asserted to logical 1 as an indication that setting \nGroup 3 is the active setting group (see Table 7.3).\nWith setting Group 3 as the active setting group, setting SS3 has priority. If \nsetting SS3 is asserted to logical 1, setting Group 3 remains the active setting \ngroup, regardless of the activity of settings SS1, SS2, SS4, SS5, and SS6. With \nsettings SS1 through SS6 all deasserted to logical 0, setting Group 3 still \nremains the active setting group.\n\nWith setting Group 3 as the active setting group, if setting SS3 is deasserted to \nlogical 0 and one of the other settings (e.g., setting SS5) asserts to logical 1, \nthe relay switches from setting Group 3 as the active setting group to another \nsetting group (e.g., setting Group 5) as the active setting group, after \nqualifying time setting TGR.\n\nTGR Group Change Delay Setting (settable from 0.00 to 16000.00 cycles)\nIn this example, TGR qualifies the assertion of setting SS5 before it can \nchange the active setting group.\n\nTable 7.4 Definitions for Active Setting Group Switching SELOGIC Control \nEquation Settings SS1 Through SS6 \n\nSetting Definition\n\nSS1 go to (or remain in) setting Group 1\nSS2 go to (or remain in) setting Group 2\nSS3 go to (or remain in) setting Group 3\nSS4 go to (or remain in) setting Group 4\nSS5 go to (or remain in) setting Group 5\nSS6 go to (or remain in) setting Group 6\n\n\n\n7.19\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nInputs, Outputs, Timers, and Other Control Logic\nMultiple Setting Groups\n\nOperation of Serial \nPort GROUP \nCommand and \nFront-Panel GROUP \nPushbutton\n\nSELOGIC control equation settings SS1–SS6 have priority over the serial port \nGROUP command, the front-panel GROUP pushbutton, DNP3, and Modbus in \nselecting the active setting group. If any one of SS1–SS6 asserts to logical 1, \nthe other group switch controls cannot be used to switch the active setting \ngroup. But if SS1–SS6 all deassert to logical 0, the other controls can be used \nto switch the active setting group.\n\nSee Section 10: Communications for more information on the serial port GROUP \ncommand. See Section 11: Front-Panel Interface for more information on the \nfront-panel GROUP pushbutton.\n\nRelay Disabled \nMomentarily During \nActive Setting Group \nChange\n\nThe relay is disabled for a few seconds while the relay is in the process of changing \nactive setting groups. Relay elements, timers, and logic are reset, unless indicated \notherwise in specific logic description [e.g., local bit (LB1– LB16), remote bit \n(RB1–RB32), and latch bit (LT1– LT16) states are retained during a active setting \ngroup change]. The output contacts do not change state until the relay enables in the \nnew settings group and the SELOGIC control equations are processed to determine \nthe output contact status for the new group. \n\nFor instance, if setting OUT105 = logical 1 in Group 2, and setting OUT105 = \nlogical 1 in Group 3, and the relay is switched from Group 2 to Group 3, \nOUT105 stays energized before, during, and after the group change. However, if \nthe Group 3 setting was OUT105 = logical 0 instead, then OUT105 remains \nenergized until the relay enables in Group 3, solves the SELOGIC control \nequations, and causes OUT105 to de-energize. See Figure 7.28, Figure 7.29, and \nFigure 7.30 for examples of output contacts in the de-energized state (i.e., \ncorresponding output contact coils de-energized).\n\nActive Setting Group \nSwitching Example 1\n\nUse a single optoisolated input to switch between two setting groups in the \nSEL-311C. In this example, optoisolated input IN105 on the relay is connected \nto a SCADA contact in Figure 7.19. Each pulse of the SCADA contact \nchanges the active setting group from one setting group (e.g., setting Group 1) \nto another (e.g., setting Group 4). The SCADA contact is not maintained, just \npulsed to switch from one active setting group to another.\n\nFigure 7.19 SCADA Contact Pulses Input IN105 to Switch Active Setting \nGroup Between Setting Groups 1 and 4\n\nIf setting Group 1 is the active setting group and the SCADA contact is pulsed, \nsetting Group 4 becomes the active setting group. If the SCADA contact is \npulsed again, setting Group 1 becomes the active setting group again. The \nsetting group control operates in a cyclical manner.\n\npulse to activate setting Group 4 ... pulse to activate setting Group 1 ... \npulse to activate setting Group 4 ... pulse to activate setting Group 1 ...\n\n(+)\n\nSCADA\n\n(—)\n\nChange Active Setting Group\n\nSEL-311C\n\nIN105\n\n\n\n7.20\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nInputs, Outputs, Timers, and Other Control Logic\nMultiple Setting Groups\n\nThis logic is implemented in the SELOGIC control equation settings in \nTable 7.5.\n\nSELOGIC control equation timer input setting SV8 in Table 7.5 has logic \noutput SV8T, shown in operation in Figure 7.20 for both setting Group 1 \nand Group 4. \n\nFigure 7.20 SELOGIC Control Equation Variable Timer SV8T Used in Setting \nGroup Switching\n\nIn this example, timer SV8T is used in both setting groups; different timers \ncould have been used with the same operational result. The SELOGIC variables \ndo not reset during the setting group change, so special programming \nconsiderations are required to allow the same timer to be used in both setting \ngroups.\n\nTimer pickup setting SV8PU is set greater than the pulse width of the SCADA \ncontact (Figure 7.19). This allows only one active setting group change (e.g., \nfrom setting Group 1 to 4) for each pulse of the SCADA contact (and \nsubsequent assertion of input IN105). The function of the SELOGIC control \nequations in Table 7.5 becomes more apparent in the following example \nscenario.\n\nTable 7.5 SELOGIC Control Equation Settings for Switching Active Setting \nGroup Between Setting Groups 1 and 4\n\nSetting Group 1 Setting Group 4\n\nSV8PU = 1.5 • SCADA pulse width\n(in cycles)\n\nSV8PU = 1.5 • SCADA pulse width\n(in cycles)\n\nSV8DO = 0.00 SV8DO = 0.00\n\nSV8 = SG1 * !/SG1 SV8 = SG4 * !/SG4\n\nSS1 = 0 SS1 = IN105 * SV8T\n\nSS2 = 0 SS2 = 0\n\nSS3 = 0 SS3 = 0\n\nSS4 = IN105 * SV8T SS4 = 0\n\nSS5 = 0 SS5 = 0\n\nSS6 = 0 SS6 = 0\n\nGlobal Setting\n\nTGR = 1.00 cycle\n\nSV8\n\nSV8T\n\nSetting Group 1 Activated\n\nSV8PU\n\nSV8 = SG1 * !/SG1 SV8T\n\nSV8PU > SCADA contact pulse width\nSV8DO = 0\n\nSetting Group 1\n\nSV8 = SG4 * !/SG4\n\nSV8\n\nSetting Group 4\n\nSV8PU > SCADA contact pulse width\nSV8DO = 0\n\nSetting Group 4 Activated\n\nSV8T SV8PU\n\nSV8T\nSV8PU\n\nSV8D0\n\nSV8PU\n\nSV8D0\n\n\n\n7.21\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nInputs, Outputs, Timers, and Other Control Logic\nMultiple Setting Groups\n\nStart Out in Setting Group 1\nRefer to Figure 7.21.\n\nThe relay has been in setting Group 1 for some time, with timer logic output \nSV8T asserted to logical 1, thus enabling SELOGIC control equation setting \nSS4 for the assertion of input IN105.\n\nSwitch to Setting Group 4\nRefer to Figure 7.21.\n\nThe SCADA contact pulses input IN105, and the active setting group changes \nto setting Group 4 after qualifying time setting TGR (set at 1.00 cycle to \nqualify the assertion of setting SS4). Optoisolated input IN105 also has its own \nbuilt-in debounce timer (IN105D) available (see Figure 7.1).\nNote that Figure 7.21 shows both setting Group 1 and setting Group 4 \nsettings. The setting Group 1 settings (top of Figure 7.21) are enabled only \nwhen setting Group 1 is the active setting group and likewise for the setting \nGroup 4 settings at the bottom of the figure.\n\nSetting Group 4 is now the active setting group, and Relay Word bit SG4 \nasserts to logical 1. One processing interval later, the expression /SG4 asserts \nto logical 1 for one processing interval, and then deasserts to logical 0. The \nexpression SV8 = SG4 * !/SG4 deasserts for once processing interval because \nthe NOT operator “!” is inverting the rising edge operator “/”. This action \nresets the timer SV8T, which must then time for SV8PU cycles in order to \nassert again. See Appendix F: Setting SELOGIC Control Equations for more \ndetails on the rising edge operator.\n\nThe TGR setting of 1.00 cycle prevents the brief assertion of SV8T in setting \nGroup 4 from prematurely initiating a group change.\n\nAfter the relay has been in setting Group 4 for a time period equal to SV8PU, \nthe timer logic output SV8T asserts to logical 1, thus enabling SELOGIC \ncontrol equation setting SS1 for a new assertion of input IN105.\n\nNote that input IN105 is still asserted as setting Group 4 is activated. Pickup \ntime SV8PU keeps the continued assertion of input IN105 from causing the \nactive setting group to revert back again to setting Group 1 for a single \nassertion of input IN105. This keeps the active setting group from being \nchanged at a time interval less than time SV8PU.\n\nSwitch Back to Setting Group 1\nRefer to Figure 7.21.\n\nThe SCADA contact pulses input IN105 a second time, and the active setting \ngroup changes back to setting Group 1 after qualifying time setting TGR (set \nat 1.00 cycle to qualify the assertion of setting SS1). Optoisolated input IN105 \nalso has its own built-in debounce timer (IN105D) available (see Figure 7.1).\nSimilar logic settings operate in setting Group 1 to deassert SV8T quickly, \nbefore the TGR timer expires, and then allow IN105 to deassert before SV8T \nasserts again.\n\n\n\n7.22\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nInputs, Outputs, Timers, and Other Control Logic\nMultiple Setting Groups\n\nFigure 7.21 Active Setting Group Switching (With Single Input) Time Line\n\nActive Setting Group \nSwitching Example 2\n\nPrevious SEL relays (e.g., SEL-321 and SEL-251 relays) have multiple \nsettings groups controlled by the assertion of three optoisolated inputs (e.g., \nIN101, IN102, and IN103) in different combinations as shown in Table 7.6.\n\nThe SEL-311C can be programmed to operate similarly.

As shown in \nTable 7.7, as the selector switch is moved from one position to another, a \ndifferent setting group is activated. The logic in Table 7.6 is implemented in \nthe SELOGIC control equation settings in Table 7.7.\n\nThe settings in Table 7.7 are made in each setting Group 1 through Group 6.\n\nSelector Switch Starts Out in Position 3\nRefer to Table 7.7 and Figure 7.23.\n\nIf the selector switch is in position 3 in Figure 7.22, setting Group 3 is the \nactive setting group (Relay Word bit SG3 = logical 1). Inputs IN101 and IN102 \nare energized and IN103 is de-energized.\n\nSS3 = !IN103 * IN102 * IN101 = NOT(IN103) * IN102 * IN101 \n= NOT(logical 0) * logical 1 * logical 1 = logical 1\n\nTo get from position 3 to position 5 on the selector switch, the switch passes \nthrough position 4.

Settings SS1–SS6 cannot result in continuous \ncyclical changing of the active setting group. Time setting TGR qualifies \nsettings SS1–SS6 before changing the active setting group. If optoisolated \ninputs IN101 through IN106 are used in settings SS1–SS6, the inputs have their \nown built-in debounce timer that can help in providing the necessary time \nqualification (see Figure 7.1).\n\nSELOGIC Control Equation Variables/Timers\nSixteen (16) SELOGIC control equation variables/timers are available. Each \nSELOGIC control equation variable/timer has a SELOGIC control equation \nsetting input and variable/timer outputs as shown in Figure 7.24 and \nFigure 7.25.\n\nThe SELOGIC variable pickup (SV1PU–SV16PU) and dropout \n(SV1DO–SV16DO) times are individually programmed in the Group settings \nclass. The number of timer settings is controlled by the ESV setting, with \nsetting choices (N, 1–16). The factory-default setting is ESV = N, which hides \nall timer settings. When hidden, the pickup and dropout times are internally \nset to 0.00 cycles.

The next state of the variables/timers depends on \nwhich scenario is encountered. The following examples cover the various \npossibilities.\n\nExample 1: Both SV7 and SV7T Asserted Before Group Change\nIf SV7 and SV7T are both asserted in Group 5, they are still asserted \nimmediately after switching to another setting group. Once the new setting \ngroup logic is processed, the SV7 variable is updated with the newly evaluated \nSV7 equation result.\n\nIf the SV7 equation evaluates to logical 0 in the new settings group, SV7 and \nSV7T immediately deassert.\n\nIf the SV7 equation evaluates to logical 1 in the new settings group, SV7 and \nSV7T remain asserted. \n\nExample 2: SV7 Asserted, SV7T Not Asserted Before Group Change\nIf SV7 is asserted in Group 5, but SV7T has not yet asserted (because it is still \ntiming on the group 5 SV7PU setting), SV7 is still asserted immediately after \nswitching to another setting group, and SV7T is deasserted. Once the new \nsetting group logic is processed, the SV7 variable is updated with the newly \nevaluated SV7 equation result.\n\nIf the SV7 equation evaluates to logical 0 in the new settings group, SV7 \ndeasserts immediately, SV7T remains deasserted, and the timer fully resets. \n\nIf the SV7 equation evaluates to logical 1 in the new settings group, SV7 \nremains asserted, and SV7T starts timing anew on its pickup setting SV7PU \nfrom the newly enabled setting group. If the SV7 equation remains at \nlogical 1, SV7T asserts after SV7PU cycles have elapsed (from the time the \nnew settings group started running).\n\nExample 3: SV7 Deasserted, SV7T Asserted Before Group Change\nIf SV7 is deasserted in Group 5, but SV7T has not yet deasserted (because it is \nstill timing on the group 5 SV7DO setting), SV7 is still deasserted \nimmediately after switching to another setting group, and SV7T stays \nasserted. Once the new setting group logic is processed, the SV7 variable is \nupdated with the newly evaluated SV7 equation result.\n\nIf the SV7 equation evaluates to logical 0 in the new settings group, SV7 stays \ndeasserted and SV7T deasserts immediately, regardless of the SV7DO setting.\n\nIf the SV7 equation evaluates to logical 1 in the new settings group, SV7 \nasserts and SV7T remains asserted.\n\nExample 4: Both SV7 and SV7T Deasserted Before Group Change\nIf SV7 and SV7T are both deasserted in Group 5, they remain deasserted \nimmediately after switching to another setting group. Once the new setting \ngroup logic is processed, the SV7 variable is updated with the newly evaluated \nSV7 equation result.\n\nIf the SV7 equation evaluates to logical 0 in the new settings group, SV7 and \nSV7T remain deasserted.\n\nNOTE: The logical condition \nimmediately after an active setting \ngroup change must be considered \nwhen developing relay settings for \nmultiple settings groups.

In Group 6, make setting \nSV7 = (SV7 + IN106) * 50BFT * !/TRGTR\n\nPress the TARGET RESET button to assert Relay Word bit TRGTR \nand break the seal-in.\n\n4. In Group 6, make setting \nSV7 = (SV7 + IN106) * 50BFT * !/IN203\n\nAssert control input IN203 to break the seal-in.\n\n\n\n7.31\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nInputs, Outputs, Timers, and Other Control Logic\nLogic Variables\n\nLogic Variables\nThe SEL-311C supports 32 logic variables (LV1 through LV32). These logic \nvariables are similar to SELOGIC control equation variables/timers \n(SV1–SV16, and SV1T–SV16T), except the LVs do not have associated \npickup/dropout timers. Use logic variables as intermediate SELOGIC control \nequation terms to help break a long SELOGIC control equation into smaller, \nsimpler equations.\n\nEach logic variable has a SELOGIC control equation (LV1, LV2, … LV32), \nand a Relay Word bit with the same label (LV1, LV2, … LV32) as shown in \nFigure 7.27.\n\nFigure 7.27 Logic Variables\n\nThere is no enable setting for the logic variables. The settings for the logic \nvariables are accessed through 32 SELOGIC control equations in the Logic \nSettings class, and each setting has a factory-default value of logical 0.\n\nSee Section 9: Setting the Relay for more information on setting classes, \nmodifying settings, and displaying settings.\n\nLogic Variable Application Ideas\nExample 1: Simplify Logic Expressions\n\nUse logic variables to consolidate settings into functional blocks. For \nexample, if a protection application requires the same logic expression in \nseveral places, a logic variable can make the resulting settings easier to read.\n\nExample settings without a logic variable.\n\nFour torque control settings requiring a common expression:\n\n67Q1TC = IN203 * LB2 + LT9 + 50P1\n67G1TC = IN203 * LB2 + LT9 + 50P1\n\n51QTC = IN203 * LB2 + LT9\n51GTC = IN203 * LB2 + LT9\n\nSame example settings using a logic variable.\n\n67Q1TC = LV1 + 50P1\n67G1TC = LV1 + 50P1\n\n51QTC = LV1 \n51GTC = LV1 \n\nLV1 = IN203 * LB2 + LT9\n\nLV1\nLV2\nLV3\n\n•  \n•  \n•  \n\nLV32\n\nLV1\nLV2\nLV3\n  •\n  •\n  •\nLV32\n\nRelay\nWord Bits\n\nSELOGIC\nSetting\n\nNOTE: The example settings are not \nfrom a real application.\n\n\n\n7.32\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nInputs, Outputs, Timers, and Other Control Logic\nLogic Variables\n\nSee Table F.4 for details on the processing order of SELOGIC control \nequations. In this example, logic variable LV1 is evaluated after the torque \ncontrol equations each processing interval, and any state change of LV1 will \nbe delayed one processing interval when used in the torque control equations. \nFor many situations this one-quarter-cycle delay is not significant, but should \nbe considered when designing settings.\n\nExample 2: Free Up SELOGIC Control Equation Variables/Timers\nUse logic variables LV1–LV32 for non-timing functions to free up SELOGIC \nvariables/timers SV1T–SV16T.\n\nExample settings without a logic variable.\n\nIn this design, SV14 is being used as a variable only:\nSV14 = (IN106 * SV13T + RB7 * LT5) * LT3 + (!59V1 + IN105 * SV13T) * !LT3\n\nSV15 = /SV14 * LB7 + \\SV14\n\nSame example settings using a logic variable.\n\nNow SV14 is available for use as a timer:\nLV6 = (IN106 * SV13T + RB7 * LT5) * LT3 + (!59V1 + IN105 * SV13T) * !LT3\n\nSV14 = available\n\nSV15 = /LV6 * LB7 + \\LV6\n\nView Logic Variables \nin CEV Reports or SER\n\nLogic variables LV1–LV32 are not shown in standard event reports (EVE \ncommand), but are present in Compressed Event Reports (CEV command).\nFor easier analysis, any of the logic variables LV1–LV32 may be included in \nthe Sequential Events Recorder (SER) trigger list. See Section 12: Standard \nEvent Reports and SER for details on event reports and SER.\n\nLogic Variable Behavior After Power Loss, Settings Change, or Group Change\nPower Loss\n\nIf power is lost to the relay, when the relay is powered back up all logic \nvariables are forced to an initial state of logical 0.\n\nSettings Change or Active Group Change Does Not Clear Logic Variables\nIf settings are changed (for the active setting group), or the active setting \ngroup is changed, the relay keeps the logical states of the logic variable Relay \nWord bits from before the change. When the relay re-enables, the Relay Word \nbits LV1–LV32 are held at their previous logic states until the relay evaluates \nthe LV1–LV32 equations and updates the Relay Word bits.\n\nThis is only important to consider when the LV1–LV32 Relay Word bit(s) are \npart of a SELOGIC control equation that is evaluated earlier in the processing \norder than the LV1–LV32 settings, and the variables are being used for \ndifferent purposes in two or more settings groups.\n\nAs shown in Table F.4, in the SEL-311C processing order, equations 52A, \n52AA, 52AB, 52AC, SET1–SET16, RST1–RST16, BSYNCH, E32IV, \nZ1XPEC, Z1XGEC, 67xxTC, 51xxTC, and CLMON are processed before the \nlogic variable equations.\n\nNOTE: The example settings are not \nfrom a real application.\n\n\n\n7.33\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nInputs, Outputs, Timers, and Other Control Logic\nVirtual Bits\n\nVirtual Bits\nThe SEL-311C supports 128 virtual bits, VB001–VB128 for the IEC 61850 \nprotocol. Virtual bits are volatile and are reset when a new CID file is loaded, \nthe device is restarted, or they are overwritten by another GOOSE message.\n\nThese Relay Word bits are active only in relays ordered with IEC 61850.\n\nWhen IEC 61850 is enabled, the relay uses the externally-created CID file to \ndefine the behavior of these virtual bits (received GOOSE messages can be \nmapped to these bits).\nOnce defined, the virtual bits can be used in SELOGIC control equations like \nany other Relay Word bit.\n\nThe CID file also defines what information gets transmitted in GOOSE \nmessages. See Appendix P: IEC 61850 for details on the IEC 61850 protocol.\n\nOutput Contacts\nFigure 7.28–Figure 7.30 show the example operation of output contact Relay \nWord bits (e.g., Relay Word bits OUT101–OUT107 in Figure 7.28) as a result \nof one of the following.\n\n➤ SELOGIC control equation operation (e.g., SELOGIC control \nequation settings OUT101–OUT107 in Figure 7.28)\n\n➤ PULSE command execution\n➤ Modbus command (see Appendix O: Modbus RTU and TCP \n\nCommunications)\nThe output contact Relay Word bits in turn control the output contacts (e.g., \noutput contacts OUT101–OUT107 in Figure 7.28).\nAlarm logic/circuitry controls the ALARM output contact (see Figure 7.28)\nFigure 7.28 is used for following discussion/examples. The output contacts in \nFigure 7.29 and Figure 7.30 operate similarly.\n\nFactory Settings \nExample\n\nIn the factory SELOGIC control equation settings, the equations of six output \ncontacts are used.\n\nOUT101 = 3PT + TPA (automatic tripping three-phase or A-phase/manual \ntripping three-phase; see Section 5: Trip and Target Logic)\n\nOUT102 = 3PT + TPB (automatic tripping three-phase or B-phase/manual \ntripping three-phase)\n\nOUT103 = 3PT + TPC (automatic tripping three-phase or C-phase/manual \ntripping three-phase)\n\nOUT104 = KEY (POTT scheme key permissive trip; see Section 5: Trip and \nTarget Logic)\n\nOUT105 = CLOSE (automatic reclosing/manual closing; see Section 6: Close \nand Reclose Logic)\n\nOUT106 = 0 (output contact OUT106 not used—set equal to zero)\nOUT107 = 0 (output contact OUT107 not used—set equal to zero)\nALRMOUT = !(SALARM + HALARM)\n\nNOTE: Do not use Figure 7.28, \nFigure 7.29, or Figure 7.30 to create \nrelay wiring diagrams.

Depending on \nthe contact type (a or b), the output contact closes or opens as demonstrated in \nFigure 7.28. An a-type output contact is open when the output contact coil is \nde-energized and closed when the output contact coil is energized. A b-type \noutput contact is closed when the output contact coil is de-energized and open \nwhen the output contact coil is energized.\n\nNotice in Figure 7.28 that all four possible combinations of output contact coil \nstates (energized or de-energized) and output contact types (a or b) are \ndemonstrated. See Output Contact Jumpers on page 2.29 for output contact \ntype options.\n\nALARM Output Contact\nRefer to Figure 7.28 and Relay Self-Tests on page 13.7.\nWith factory-default logic settings, when the relay is operational and there are \nno alarm conditions, the ALARM output contact coil is energized and the Relay \nWord bit ALARM is deasserted. When an alarm occurs, the ALARM output \ncontact closes or opens, depending on the ALARM output contact type (a or b), \nas demonstrated in Figure 7.28, and Relay Word bit ALARM asserts.\n\nThe alarm outputs are controlled by SELOGIC control equation ALRMOUT. \nThe default setting for this equation is shown below.\n\nALRMOUT = !(SALARM + HALARM)\n\nWith this setting, SELOGIC control equation and Relay Word bit ALRMOUT \nare asserted and the ALARM output relay coil is energized when the relay has \npower and there are no alarm conditions. OUT107, if it is configured as an \nalarm output using mainboard jumper JMP10, is also energized. As shown in \nFigure 7.28, Relay Word bit ALARM is deasserted, because it is the opposite \nof ALRMOUT.\n\nWhen a software or hardware alarm condition occurs, SELOGIC control \nequation and Relay Word bit ALRMOUT are deasserted, Relay Word bit \nALARM is asserted, and the ALARM output relay coil is de-energized. \nOUT107, if it is configured as an alarm output using mainboard jumper JMP10, \nis also de-energized.\n\nThe ALARM and OUT107 output relay coils are also de-energized if the relay \nrestarts, there is a loss of power, or a failure prevents the relay from operating.\n\nThe alarm output contacts can be programmed to change state for the \nfollowing reasons.\n\n1. Software alarm conditions programmed in SELOGIC control \nequation SALARM.\n\n2. Hardware warning or failure conditions from relay self-test \nlogic.\n\nNOTE: Firmware versions R502 and \nearlier have fixed alarm logic. Refer to \nthe documentation provided with \nearlier firmware for details on the \noperation of the ALARM output.\n\nNOTE: The default setting of SELOGIC \ncontrol equation ALRMOUT mimics \nthe alarm behavior of firmware \nversions R502 and earlier.\n\n\n\n7.35\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nInputs, Outputs, Timers, and Other Control Logic\nOutput Contacts\n\nSoftware alarm conditions are programmed in SELOGIC control equation \nSALARM and may be modified as necessary for the application. The \nfollowing Relay Word bits are available to monitor software alarm conditions.\n\nACCESS—Asserts while any user is logged in at Access Level B or \nhigher.\n\nACCESSP—Pulses for approximately one second when any user \nincreases to Access Level B or higher.\n\nSETCHG—Pulses for approximately one second when settings are \nchanged or saved. \n\nSETCHG does not pulse when settings are reset to defaults or when the \nactive settings group switches.\n\nCHGPASS—Pulses for approximately one second whenever a password \nchanges.\n\nPASNVAL—Pulses for approximately one second when an incorrect \npassword is entered when attempting to enter Access Level B or higher, \nor when an incorrect password is entered when attempting to change \npasswords.\n\nBADPASS—Pulses for approximately one second whenever a user enters \nthree successive incorrect passwords in an SEL ASCII terminal session or \nweb session.\n\nGRPSW—Pulses for approximately one second when the relay switches \nactive settings group.\n\nThese Relay Word bits are intended for indication only and should not be used \nin protection logic.\n\nIn default settings, SELOGIC control equation SALARM is set as follows.\nSALARM = BADPASS + CHGPASS + SETCHG + GRPSW + ACCESSP + PASNVAL\n\nHardware alarm conditions are generated by the relay self-test logic (see \nTable 13.3) and are classified as warnings or failures, depending upon \nseverity. Relay Word bit HALARM pulses for approximately five seconds to \nindicate that a hardware warning has occurred and asserts continuously when \nthere is a hardware failure. Additional hardware alarm Relay Word bits \nHALARMP, HALARML, and HALARMA are available to support custom \nalarm schemes. See Relay Self-Tests on page 13.7.\nIn a standard shipment, the ALARM output is a Form B contact. This contact \ncloses to alarm with the factory-default logic. If a Form A contact is necessary \n(open to alarm), do not change the ALRMOUT SELOGIC control equation so \nthat the ALARM output must energize to alarm, as this will cause incorrect \nalarm operation during hardware and power failures. Instead, use OUT107 as \nan extra alarm output or change the ALARM output to a Form A contact. See \nOutput Contact Jumpers on page 2.29 and “Extra Alarm” Output Contact \nControl Jumper on page 2.29.\n\nTo verify ALARM output contact mechanical integrity, execute the serial port \ncommand PULSE ALARM. Execution of this command momentarily \nde-energizes the ALARM output contact coil.\n\nNotice in Figure 7.28 that all possible combinations of ALARM output contact \ncoil states (energized or de-energized) and output contact types (a or b) are \ndemonstrated. See Output Contact Jumpers on page 2.29 for output contact \ntype options.\n\nNOTE: The SALARM setting makes \nthe software alarm behavior similar to \nthat of firmware version R502 and \nearlier. SETCHG now pulses when \nPort, DNP, and Modbus settings are \nsaved and when settings are copied \ninto a settings group that is not the \nactive settings group. The alarm \noutput does not pulse for these \nsettings save operations in R502 and \nearlier.\n\n\n\n7.36\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nInputs, Outputs, Timers, and Other Control Logic\nOutput Contacts\n\nOutput Contacts OUT201–OUT2xx (On Relays With Optional Extra \nInput/Output Board)\n\nRefer to Figure 7.29 and Figure 7.30.\n\nThe various input/output board choices have 4, 8, or 12 outputs that act in a \nsimilar fashion to those described in Output Contacts OUT101–OUT107. \nHowever, not all I/O boards support type b contact configuration on all \noutputs. See Output Contact Jumpers on page 2.29 for full information.\n\nq The PULSE command is also available via the front panel (CNTRL pushbutton, “output contact testing” option).

For example, if an SEL-311C is protecting a \n230 kV transmission line, labeled “Line 1204,” the line name can be \npermanently included in the display with the following settings.\n\nDP5 = 1 (set directly to logical 1)\nDP5_1 = LINE 1204 (displays when DP5 = logical 1)\nDP5_0 = (“blank”)\n\nThis results in the display of text setting DP5_1 on the front-panel display.\n\nThis can also be realized with the following settings.\nDP5 = 0 (set directly to logical 0)\nDP5_1 = (“blank”)\nDP5_0 = LINE 1204 (displays when DP5 = logical 0)\n\nThis results in the display of text setting DP5_0 on the front-panel display.\n\nActive Setting Group \nSwitching \nConsiderations\n\nThe SELOGIC control equation display point settings DPn (n = 1 through 16) \nare available separately in each setting group.

These \nquantities are indicated with an “x” mark in the Display Points column in Table E.1.\n\nThe available analog values cover metering, breaker wear monitor, and \ntime-overcurrent element pickup values.\n\nIn general, any of these values can be selected for the rotating display with a \nleading two-character sequence.\n\n “::” (double colon)\nfollowed by the analog quantity name (mnemonic) in the display point text \nsetting DPn_1 or DPn_0. For example, to display peak demand currents for \ncurrents IA, IB, IC, and IN, make the following text (SET T command) and \nlogic (SET L command) settings.\n\nLogic settings DP1–DP4 are permanently set to logical 0 in this example. This \ncauses the corresponding DPn_0 value to permanently rotate in the display (the \nmnemonics in the DPn_0 settings indicate the value displayed, per Table E.1). \n\nValues Displayed for Incorrect Settings\nIf the display point setting does not match the correct format (using the \nleading two-character sequence “::” followed by the correct mnemonic), the \nrelay will display the setting text string as it was actually entered, without \nsubstituting the display value.\n\nAgain, logic settings DP1 and DP2 are permanently set to logical 0. This \ncauses the corresponding DPn_0 value to permanently rotate in the display. \nWith the DPn_0 setting problems just discussed, the relay displays the setting \ntext string as it was actually entered, without substituting the intended display \nvalue from Table E.1.\n\nSET T SET L\n\nDP1_0 = ::IAPK DP1 = 0\n\nDP2_0 = ::IBPK DP2 = 0\n\nDP3_0 = ::ICPK DP3 = 0\n\nDP4_0 = ::INPK DP4 = 0\n\nIA  PEAK = 603.5\nIB  PEAK = 598.7\n\nIC  PEAK = 605.1\nIN  PEAK = 88.2\n\nSET T SET L\n\nDP1_0 = :IAPK (missing “:”) DP1 = 0\nDP2_0 = ::IBPJ (misspelled mnemonic)      DP2 = 0\n\n:IAPK\n::IBPJ\n\n\n\n7.45\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nInputs, Outputs, Timers, and Other Control Logic\nRotating Display\n\nExtra Details for Displaying Metering Values on the Rotating Display\nTable E.1 lists all the available metering values that can be configured to rotate \non the default display, subject to the number of available display points. These \nvalues correspond to the primary metering values available via the METER \ncommand [MET (Instantaneous), MET X (Extended Instantaneous), MET D \n(Demand), and MET E (Energy); see Section 10: Communications for serial \nport commands].\n\nAutomatic Decimal Point\nMany of the magnitude values are displayed with as many as three digits \nbehind the decimal point. For example, to display the ::IA value in Table E.1 \nthe relay uses a magnitude field and a phase-angle field. The relay \nautomatically selects the number of decimal digits to fit in the magnitude \ndisplay as shown in these sample screens.\n\nMagnitudes less than 10 display with three digits behind the decimal point.\n\nMagnitudes greater than or equal to 10 display with two or fewer digits behind \nthe decimal point.\n\nExtra Details for Displaying Breaker Wear Monitor Quantities on the \nRotating Default Display\n\nTable E.1 lists all the available breaker wear monitor values that can be \nconfigured to rotate on the display, subject to the number of available display \npoints. These values correspond to the breaker monitor values available via \nthe BRE (Breaker) command (see Section 10: Communications for serial port \ncommands). \nSee Breaker Monitor on page 8.1 details on configuring the breaker monitor \nfunction.\n\nThis example demonstrates use of the rotating display to show breaker wear \nmonitor quantities automatically on the rotating display. This example will set \nthe EXTTRA, INTTRA, INTIA, EXTIA, and WEARA quantities to display \nin the rotating display.\n\nSet the following settings.\n\nIA= 8.372A    0°\n\nIA= 52.37A    0°\nIB= 635.8A -120°\n\nIC= 1173A   120°\n\nSET T SET L\n\nDP1_0 = ::EXTTRA DP1 = 0\n\nDP2_0 = ::INTTRA DP2 = 0\n\nDP3_0 = ::INTIA DP3 = 0\n\nNOTE: Some of the labels for breaker \nmonitor quantities differ between \nrelays. For example, the SEL-311C uses \nthe label ::INTIA, where legacy SEL-311 \nrelays have used ::CTRLIA for the same \nquantity. See the notes after Table E.1 \nfor details.\n\n\n\n7.46\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nInputs, Outputs, Timers, and Other Control Logic\nRotating Display\n\nSetting DPn = 0 and using the DPn_0 in the text settings allows the setting to \npermanently rotate in the display. The DPn logic equation can be set to control \nthe text display—turning it on and off under certain conditions.

As with the previously described display points, the operator \ndoes not need to press any buttons to see this information.\n\nTo program a display point to show the pickup setting of a time-overcurrent \nelement, first enter the two-character sequence “::” (double colon) followed by \nthe name of the desired time-overcurrent element pickup setting (e.g., 51PP, \n51GP, or 51QP).\nFor example, with the factory-default settings for 51GP and CTR, setting \nDP4_0 =::51GP will display 150.00 A pri.\n\nThe relay calculates the value to display by multiplying the 51GP setting \n(0.75 A secondary) by the CTR setting (200), arriving at 150.00 A primary. \nThe relay displays the display point DP4_0 because the factory-default \nSELOGIC control equation DP4 = 0 (logical 0).\nThe calculations for the remaining time-overcurrent elements are similar.\n\nIf the display point setting does not match the correct format, the relay will \ndisplay the setting text string as it was actually entered, without substituting \nthe time-overcurrent element setting value.\n\nDisplaying Time-Overcurrent Elements Example\nThis example demonstrates use of the rotating display to show \ntime-overcurrent elements in primary units. This example will set the 51PP \nand 51GP to display in the rotating display.\n\nDP4_0 = ::EXTIA DP4 = 0\n\nDP5_0 = ::WEARA DP5 = 0\n\nSET T SET L\n\nEXTA TRIPS=    4\nINTA TRIPS=   67\n\nINT IA=     2 kA\nEXT IA=   122 kA\n\nWEAR A=    16 %\n\n\n\n7.47\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nInputs, Outputs, Timers, and Other Control Logic\nRotating Display\n\nSet the following settings.\n\nSetting DPn = 0 and using the DPn_0 in the text settings allows the setting to \npermanently rotate in the display. The DPn logic equation can be set to control \nthe text display—turning it on and off under certain conditions. With the relay \nset as shown above, the LCD will display first,\n\nthen,\n\nWith the control string set on the even display points “DP2, DP4, DP6, …” \nand the description set on the odd display points “DP1, DP3, …,” each screen \nthe relay scrolls through will have a description with the value below it.\n\nAdditional Format for Displaying Time-Overcurrent Elements on the \nRotating Display\n\nThe previous method for displaying Time-Overcurrent Element pickup values \nrequired two display points per overcurrent element: one display points acts as \nthe title, and the other contains the data. Because this reduces the number of \ndisplay points available for other reporting functions, a special one-line format \nis available for the Time-Overcurrent Element pickup values.\n\nInstead of the double colon operator (e.g., ::51PP), the special formatting \noptions use a double or triple semi-colon operator (e.g. ;;51PP or ;;;51PP), and \ndescriptive text may be entered.\n\nTo set the description and the control string of time-overcurrent element on \none display point, use the following SET T format.\n\nDPi_j = XXX;;[;]ABCDE;YYY\n\nSET SET T SET L\n\nCTR = 100 DP1_0 = PHASE TRIPS AT DP1 = 0\n\nDP2_0 = ::51PP DP2 = 0\n\nE51P = Y DP3_0 = GROUND TRIPS AT DP3 = 0\n\nE51G = Y DP4_0 = ::51GP DP4 = 0\n\n51PP = 5\n\n51GP = 1\n\nPHASE TRIPS AT\n   500.00 A pri\n\nGROUND TRIPS AT\n   100.00 A pri\n\nwhere:\ni is a display point number from 1 to 16.\nj is either 1 or 0 (logic high or low).\n\nXXX is an optional prelabel consisting of any characters that \nyou wish to add for labeling the setting value.\n\nNOTE: Some of the labels for time \novercurrent element \";;;\"quantities \nshown in Table 7.8 differ between \nrelays.

Set point KASP2, COSP2 \nshould be set to provide the best “curve-fit” with the plotted breaker \nmaintenance points in Figure 8.1.\n\nEach phase (A, B, and C) has its own breaker maintenance curve (like that in \nFigure 8.2), because the separate circuit breaker interrupting contacts for \nphases A, B, and C do not necessarily interrupt the same magnitude current \n(depending on fault type and loading).\n\nTable 8.2 Breaker Monitor Settings and Settings Ranges\n\nSetting Definition Range\n\nCOSP1 Close/Open set point 1—maximum 0–65000 close/open operations\n\nCOSP2 Close/Open set point 2—middle 0–65000 close/open operations\n\nCOSP3 Close/Open set point 3—minimum 0–65000 close/open operations\n\nKASP1 kA Interrupted set point 1—minimum 0.00–999.00 kA in 0.01 kA steps\n\nKASP2 kA Interrupted set point 1—middle 0.00–999.00 kA in 0.01 kA steps\n\nKASP3 kA Interrupted set point 1—maximum 0.00–999.00 kA in 0.01 kA steps\n\nBKMONA SELOGIC® control equation, A-phase \nbreaker monitor initiation setting\n\nRelay Word bits referenced in \nTable D.1\n\nBKMONB SELOGIC control equation, B-phase \nbreaker monitor initiation setting\n\nRelay Word bits referenced in \nTable D.1\n\nBKMONC SELOGIC control equation, C-phase \nbreaker monitor initiation setting\n\nRelay Word bits referenced in \nTable D.1\n\n\n\n8.4\n\nSEL-311C-2-3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nMetering and Monitoring\nBreaker Monitor\n\nFigure 8.2 Breaker Maintenance Curve for a 25 kV Circuit Breaker\n\nIn Figure 8.2, note that the breaker maintenance curve levels off horizontally \nbelow set point KASP1, COSP1. This is the close/open operation limit of the \ncircuit breaker (COSP1 = 10000), regardless of interrupted current value.\nAlso, note that the breaker maintenance curve falls vertically above set point \nKASP3, COSP3. This is the maximum interrupted current limit of the circuit \nbreaker (KASP3 = 20.0 kA). If the interrupted current is greater than setting \nKASP3, the interrupted current is accumulated as a current value equal to \nsetting KASP3.\n\nOperation of SELOGIC Control Equation Breaker Monitor Initiation \nSetting BKMON\n\nThe SELOGIC control equation breaker monitor initiation setting BKMONn in \nTable 8.2 determines when the breaker monitor reads in the corresponding \nphase current value (Phases A, B, and/or C) for the breaker maintenance curve \n(see Figure 8.2) and the breaker monitor accumulated currents/trips (see BRE \nCommand (Breaker Monitor Data) on page 10.35).\nThe BKMONn setting looks for a rising edge (logical 0 to logical 1 transition) \nas the indication to read in the corresponding phase current value. The \nacquired current value is then applied to the breaker maintenance curve and \nthe breaker monitor accumulated currents/trips (see references in previous \nparagraph).\nIn the factory-default settings, the SELOGIC control equation breaker monitor \ninitiation settings are listed below:\n\nBKMONA = TPA + 3PT (TPA and 3PT are logical outputs of Figure 5.1)\nBKMONB = TPB + 3PT (TPB and 3PT are logical outputs of Figure 5.1)\nBKMONC = TPC + 3PT (TPC and 3PT are logical outputs of Figure 5.1)\n\nNu\nm\n\nbe\nr o\n\nf C\nlo\n\nse\n/O\n\npe\nn \n\nOp\ner\n\nat\nio\n\nns\n\n10,000\n100%\n\n1000\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\n100\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\n10\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 5040302010.5\nkA Interrupted per Operation\n\nKASP1 = 1.2\nCOSP1 = 10000\n\nKASP2 = 8.0\nCOSP2 = 150\n\nKASP3 = 20.0\nCOSP3 = 12\n\nNOTE: In the following discussion \nthree elements are specified, one for \neach phase (n = A, B, and C). The relay \nonly reads and records phase values \nwhen the corresponding BKMONn bit \nis asserted.\n\n\n\n8.5\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nMetering and Monitoring\nBreaker Monitor\n\nRefer to Figure 8.3. When BKMONn asserts (Relay Word bit TPn or 3PT \ngoes from logical 0 to logical 1), the breaker monitor reads in the \ncorresponding phase current values and applies it to the breaker monitor \nmaintenance curve and the breaker monitor accumulated currents/trips.\n\nAs detailed in Figure 8.3, the breaker monitor actually reads in the current \nvalues 1.5 cycles after the assertion of BKMONn. This helps especially if an \ninstantaneous trip occurs. The instantaneous element trips when the fault \ncurrent reaches its pickup setting level. The fault current may still be \n“climbing” to its full value and then level off. The 1.5-cycle delay on reading \nin the current values allows time for the fault current to level off.\n\nFigure 8.3 Operation of SELOGIC Control Equation Breaker Monitor Initiation \nSetting\n\nSee Figure 8.10 and accompanying text for more information on setting \nBKMONn. The operation of the breaker monitor maintenance curve, when \nnew current values are read in, is explained in the following example.\n\nBreaker Monitor \nOperation Example\n\nAs stated earlier, each phase (A, B, and C) has its own breaker maintenance \ncurve. For this example, presume that the interrupted current values occur on a \nsingle phase in Figure 8.4–Figure 8.7. Also, presume that the circuit breaker \ninterrupting contacts have no wear at first (brand new or recent maintenance \nperformed).\nNote in the following four figures (Figure 8.4–Figure 8.7) that the interrupted \ncurrent in a given figure is the same magnitude for all the interruptions (e.g., \nin Figure 8.5, 2.5 kA is interrupted 290 times). This is not realistic, but helps \nin demonstrating the operation of the breaker maintenance curve and how it \nintegrates for varying current levels.\n\n0 Percent to 10 Percent Breaker Wear\nRefer to Figure 8.4. 7.0 kA is interrupted 20 times (20 close/open operations = \n20 – 0), pushing the breaker maintenance curve from the 0 percent wear level \nto the 10 percent wear level.\n\nCompare the 100 percent and 10 percent curves and note that for a given \ncurrent value, the 10 percent curve has only 1/10 of the close/open operations \nof the 100 percent curve.\n\n10 Percent to 25 Percent Breaker Wear\nRefer to Figure 8.5. The current value changes from 7.0 kA to 2.5 kA. 2.5 kA is \ninterrupted 290 times (290 close/open operations = 480 –190), pushing the breaker \nmaintenance curve from the 10 percent wear level to the 25 percent wear level.\n\nCompare the 100 percent and 25 percent curves and note that for a given \ncurrent value, the 25 percent curve has only 1/4 of the close/open operations \nof the 100 percent curve.\n\nRead in\nCurrent Values\n\nBKMONn 1.5 Cycle\n\nRising\nEdge\n\n\n\n8.6\n\nSEL-311C-2-3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nMetering and Monitoring\nBreaker Monitor\n\n25 Percent to 50 Percent Breaker Wear\nRefer to Figure 8.6. The current value changes from 2.5 kA to 12.0 kA. \n12.0 kA is interrupted 11 times (11 close/open operations = 24–13), pushing \nthe breaker maintenance curve from the 25 percent wear level to the 50 \npercent wear level.\n\nCompare the 100 percent and 50 percent curves and note that for a given \ncurrent value, the 50 percent curve has only 1/2 of the close/open operations \nof the 100 percent curve.\n\n50 Percent to 100 Percent Breaker Wear\nRefer to Figure 8.7. The current value changes from 12.0 kA to 1.5 kA. 1.5 kA \nis interrupted 3000 times (3000 close/open operations = 6000 –3000), pushing \nthe breaker maintenance curve from the 50 percent wear level to the 100 \npercent wear level.\n\nWhen the breaker maintenance curve reaches 100 percent for a particular \nphase, the percentage wear remains at 100 percent (even if additional current \nis interrupted), until reset by the BRE R command (see View or Reset Breaker \nMonitor Information on page 8.10).

If this time does not exceed the slow operating time \nthreshold, the new operate time is combined with previous data to calculate \nthe average operating time. If the time exceeds the threshold, a plus (+) sign is \nappended to indicate the slow operation. If the time exceeds the threshold by \nmore than 100 milliseconds, timing is stopped. This information can be \nviewed with the BRE command.

For example, if \nbreaker contact wear has reached the 100 percent wear level for A-phase, the \ncorresponding Relay Word bit BCWA asserts (BCWA = logical 1). Execution \nof the BRE R command resets the wear levels for all three phases back to 0 \npercent and consequently causes Relay Word bit BCWA to deassert (BCWA = \nlogical 0).\n\nVia Front Panel\nThe information available via the BRE command is also available via the \nfront-panel OTHER pushbutton, with the exception of the electrical and \nmechanical operate times and the minimum dc voltage.

The relay \nresets the function when the setting first asserts (rising edge, e.g., a logical 0 to \na logical 1 transition). For an example of how to use the RST_BK setting, see \nthe similar function View or Reset Energy Metering Information on page 8.27.\n\nDetermination of \nRelay Initiated Trips \nand Externally \nInitiated Trips\n\nSee BRE Command (Breaker Monitor Data) on page 10.35. Note in the BRE \ncommand response that the accumulated number of trips and accumulated \ninterrupted current are separated into two groups of data: that generated by \nrelay initiated trips (Rly Trip Count) and that generated by externally initiated \ntrips (Ext Trip Count). The categorization of this information is determined by \nthe status of the TRIP Relay Word bit when the SELOGIC control equation \nbreaker monitor initiation setting BKMONn operates.\n\nRefer to Figure 8.3 and accompanying explanation. If BKMONn newly \nasserts (logical 0 to logical 1 transition), the relay reads in the corresponding \nphase current value (Phases A, B, and/or C). Now the decision has to be made: \nwhere is this current and trip count information accumulated? Under relay \ninitiated trips or externally initiated trips?\n\nTo make this determination, the status of the TRIP Relay Word bit is checked \nat the instant BKMONn newly asserts (TRIP is the logic output of Figure 5.1). \nIf TRIP is asserted (TRIP = logical 1), the corresponding phase current and \ntrip count information is accumulated under relay initiated trips (Rly Trip \nCount and Rly Accum Pri Current [kA]). If TRIP is deasserted (TRIP = \nlogical 0), the corresponding phase current and trip count information is \naccumulated under externally initiated trips (Ext Trip Count and Ext Accum \nPri Current [kA]).\nRegardless of whether the current and trip count information is accumulated \nunder relay initiated trips or externally initiated trips, this same information is \nrouted to the breaker maintenance curve for continued breaker wear \nintegration (see Figure 8.4–Figure 8.7).\nRelay initiated trips (Rly Trip Count) are also referred to as internally \ninitiated trips (Internal Trip Counter) in the course of this manual; the terms \nare interchangeable.\n\nFactory-Default Setting Example\nAs discussed previously, the SELOGIC control equation breaker monitor \ninitiation factory-default settings are shown below.\n\nBKMONA = TPA + 3PT\n\nBKMONB = TPB + 3PT\n\nBKMONC = TPC + 3PT\n\nThus, any new assertion of BKMONn will be deemed a relay trip, and the \ncurrent and trip count information is accumulated under relay initiated trips \n(Rly Trip Count).\n\nAdditional Example\nRefer to Figure 8.10. Output contact OUT101 is set to provide tripping.\n\nOUT101 = TRIP\n\nNote that optoisolated input IN106 monitors the trip bus. If the trip bus is \nenergized by output contact OUT101, an external control switch, or some other \nexternal trip, then IN106 is asserted.\n\n\n\n8.13\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nMetering and Monitoring\nStation DC Battery Monitor\n\nFigure 8.10 Input IN106 Connected to Trip Bus for Breaker Monitor Initiation\n\nIf the SELOGIC control equation breaker monitor initiation setting is set,\nBKMONn = IN106\n\nthen the SEL-311C breaker monitor sees all trips.\n\nIf output contact OUT101 asserts, energizing the trip bus, the breaker monitor \nwill deem it a relay initiated trip. This is because when BKMONn is newly \nasserted (input IN106 energized), the TRIP Relay Word bit is asserted. Thus, \nthe corresponding phase current and trip count information is accumulated \nunder relay initiated trips (Rly Trip Count and Rly Accum Pri Current [kA]).\nIf the control switch trip (or some other external trip) asserts, energizing the \ntrip bus, the breaker monitor will deem it an externally initiated trip. This is \nbecause when BKMONn is newly asserted (input IN106 energized), the TRIP \nRelay Word bit is deasserted. Thus, the corresponding phase current and trip \ncount information is accumulated under externally initiated trips (Ext Trip \nCount and Ext Accum Pri Current [kA]).\n\nStation DC Battery Monitor\nThe station dc battery monitor in the SEL-311C can alarm for under- or \novervoltage dc battery conditions and give a view of how much the station dc \nbattery voltage dips when tripping, closing, and other dc control functions \ntake place. The monitor measures the station dc battery voltage applied to the \nrear-panel terminals labeled POWER (see Figure 2.2 through Figure 2.6). The \nstation dc battery monitor settings (DCLOP and DCHIP) are available via the \nSET G command (see Table 9.2 and also Breaker Monitor Settings on \npage SET.3).\n\nDC Under- and \nOvervoltage \nElements\n\nRefer to Figure 8.11. The station dc battery monitor compares the measured \nstation battery voltage (Vdc) to the undervoltage (low) and overvoltage (high) \npickups DCLOP and DCHIP. The setting range for pickup settings DCLOP \nand DCHIP is shown below.\n\n20 to 300 Vdc, 0.02 Vdc increments\n\nThis range allows the SEL-311C to monitor nominal battery voltages of 24, \n48, 110, 125, 220, and 250 V. When testing the pickup settings DCLOP and \nDCHIP, do not operate the SEL-311C outside of its power supply limits. See \nthe Specifications subsection General on page 1.2 for the various power \nsupply specifications. The power supply rating is located on the serial number \nsticker on the relay rear panel.\n\nTC\n\nCS/T\n(Control \nSwitch Trip)Other \n\nExternal \nTrips\n\nOUT101 \n= TRIP\n\nTRIP\nCOIL\n\n52A\n\nIN106\n\nTrip Bus\n\nSEL-311C\n\n(+)\n\n(—)\n\n\n\n8.14\n\nSEL-311C-2-3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nMetering and Monitoring\nStation DC Battery Monitor\n\nFigure 8.11 DC Under- and Overvoltage Elements\n\nLogic outputs DCLO and DCHI in Figure 8.11 operate as follows.\n\nCreate Desired Logic \nfor DC Under- and \nOvervoltage Alarming\n\nPickup settings DCLOP and DCHIP are set independently.

Thus, the resultant dc voltage element at the bottom \nof Figure 8.12 would probably be a better choice—see following discussion.\n\nDCLO > DCHI (Bottom of Figure 8.12)\nOutput contact OUT106 asserts when the following condition is true.\n\nDCHIP  Vdc  DCLOP\nPickup settings DCLOP and DCHIP are set such that output contact OUT106 \nasserts when dc battery voltage stays between allowable limits.\n\nIf the relay loses power entirely (Vdc = 0 Vdc),\nVdc  DCHIP\n\nthen output contact OUT106 should logically deassert (according to bottom of \nFigure 8.12), and this is surely what happens for a total loss of power (all \noutput contacts deassert on total loss of power).\n\nOutput Contact Type Considerations (a or b)\nRefer to Output Contacts on page 7.33 (especially Note 2 in Figure 7.28, \nFigure 7.29, and Figure 7.30). Consider the output contact type (a or b) \nneeded for output contact OUT106 in the bottom of Figure 8.12 (dc voltage \nalarm example).\nIf SELOGIC control equation setting OUT106 is asserted (OUT106 = SV4T = \nlogical 1; dc voltage OK), the state of output contact OUT106 (according to \ncontact type) is as listed below.\n\n➤ closed (a-type output contact)\n➤ open (b-type output contact)\n\nIf SELOGIC control equation setting OUT106 is deasserted (OUT106 = \nSV4T = logical 0; dc voltage not OK), the state of output contact OUT106 \n(according to contact type) is as listed below.\n\n➤ open (a-type output contact)\n➤ closed (b-type output contact)\n\nIf the relay loses power entirely, all output contacts deassert, and the state of \noutput contact OUT106 (according to contact type) is as listed below.\n\n➤ open (a-type output contact)\n➤ closed (b-type output contact)\n\nAdditional \nApplication\n\nOther than alarming, the dc voltage elements can be used to disable reclosing.\n\nFor example, if the station dc batteries have a problem and the station dc \nbattery voltage is declining, drive the reclosing relay to lockout.\n\n79DTL = !SV4T + ...

When dc voltage falls \nbelow pickup DCHIP, timer output SV4T drops out (= logical 0), driving the \nrelay to lockout.\n\n79DTL = !SV4T + ... = NOT(SV4T) + ... = NOT(logical 0) + ... = logical 1\nCircuit breaker tripping and closing requires station dc battery energy. If the \nstation dc batteries are having a problem and the station dc battery voltage is \ndeclining, the relay should not reclose after a trip because there might not be \nenough dc battery energy to trip a second time after a reclose.\n\nView Station DC Battery Voltage\nVia Serial Port\n\nSee MET Command (Metering Data) on page 10.51. The MET command \ndisplays the station dc battery voltage (labeled VDC).\n\nVia Front Panel\nThe information available via the previously discussed MET serial port \ncommand is also available via the front-panel METER pushbutton. See \nFigure 11.3.\n\nVia Fast Meter, DNP, Modbus, or IEC 61850\nThe station dc battery voltage reading VDC is available via Fast Meter, DNP, \nModbus, and IEC 61850. See the Instantaneous Metering section of Table E.1.\n\nAnalyze Station DC \nBattery Voltage\n\nSee Standard 15/30/60/180-Cycle Event Reports on page 12.2. The station dc \nbattery voltage is displayed in column Vdc in the example event report in \nFigure 12.7. Changes in station dc battery voltage for an event (e.g., circuit \nbreaker tripping) can be observed. Use the EVE command to retrieve event \nreports as discussed in Section 12.\n\nStation DC Battery Voltage Dips During Circuit Breaker Tripping\nEvent reports are automatically generated when the TRIP Relay Word bit \nasserts (TRIP is the logic output of Figure 5.1). For example, output contact \nOUT101 is set to trip.\n\nOUT101 = TRIP\n\nAnytime output contact OUT101 closes and energizes the circuit breaker trip \ncoil. Any dip in station dc battery voltage can be observed in column Vdc in \nthe event report.\n\nTo generate an event report for external trips, make connections similar to \nFigure 8.10 and program optoisolated input IN106 (monitoring the trip bus) in \nthe SELOGIC control equation event report generation setting.\n\nER = /IN106 + ...\n\nAnytime the trip bus is energized, any dip in station dc battery voltage can be \nobserved in column Vdc in the event report.\n\nStation DC Battery Voltage Dips During Circuit Breaker Closing\nTo generate an event report when the SEL-311C closes the circuit breaker, \nmake the SELOGIC control equation event report generation setting.\n\nER = /OUT102 + ...\n\n\n\n8.17\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nMetering and Monitoring\nFundamental (Instantaneous) Metering\n\nIn this example, output contact OUT102 is set to close.\nOUT102 = CLOSE (CLOSE is the logic output of Figure 6.5)\n\nAnytime output contact OUT102 closes and energizes the circuit breaker close \ncoil, any dip in station dc battery voltage can be observed in column Vdc in the \nevent report.\n\nThis event report generation setting (ER = /OUT102 + ...) might be made just \nas a testing setting. Generate several event reports when doing circuit breaker \nclose testing and observe the “signature” of the station dc battery voltage in \ncolumn Vdc in the event reports.\n\nStation DC Battery Voltage Dips Anytime\nTo generate an event report anytime there is a station dc battery voltage dip, \nset the dc voltage element directly in the SELOGIC control equation event \nreport generation setting.\n\nER = \\SV4T + ...\n\nTimer output SV4T is an example dc voltage element from the bottom of \nFigure 8.12. Anytime dc voltage falls below pickup DCHIP, timer output \nSV4T drops out (logical 1 to logical 0 transition), creating a falling-edge \ncondition that generates an event report.\n\nAlso, the Sequential Event Recorder (SER) report can be used to time-tag \nstation dc battery voltage dips (see Sequential Events Recorder (SER) Report \non page 12.28).\n\nOperation of Station \nDC Battery Monitor \nWhen AC Voltage Is \nPowering the Relay\n\nIf the SEL-311C has a power supply that can be powered by ac voltage, when \npowering the relay with ac voltage, the dc voltage elements in Figure 8.11 see \nthe average of the sampled ac voltage powering the relay, which is very near \nzero volts (as displayed in column Vdc in event reports). Thus, pickup settings \nDCLOP and DCHIP should be set off (DCLOP = OFF, DCHIP = OFF).

These values \nrespond to the fundamental signal at the measured system frequency, which is \nusually near 50 Hz or 60 Hz. Frequency tracking ensures that frequency \nvariations do not adversely affect metering accuracy.\n\nThe fundamental metering function updates the metering values \napproximately twice per second.\n\nThe relay converts the metered values to primary units using the current \ntransformer ratio Group settings CTR and CTRN, and potential transformer \nratio Group settings PTR and PTRS.\n\nNOTE: The BRE and BRE H commands \ndisplay the minimum dc voltage \nrecorded by the breaker monitor when \nthe breaker trips or closes.\n\n\n\n8.18\n\nSEL-311C-2-3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nMetering and Monitoring\nVoltage Connections for Metering\n\nThe metered values are available through several interfaces.\n\n➤ Serial port ASCII communications; see MET Command \n(Metering Data) on page 10.51\n\n➤ Serial port Fast Meter communications; see Appendix J: \nConfiguration, Fast Meter, and Fast Operate Commands\n\n➤ DNP (Serial Port or Ethernet); see Appendix L: DNP3 \nCommunications\n\n➤ Modbus (Serial Port or Ethernet); see Appendix O: Modbus \nRTU and TCP Communications\n\n➤ IEC 61850 (Ethernet); see Appendix P: IEC 61850\n➤ Front-panel LCD; see Front-Panel Pushbutton Operation on \n\npage 11.1\n\n➤ Display points; see Displaying Analog Values on the Rotating \nDisplay on page 7.44\n\nSee Specifications on page 1.2 for a listing of the fundamental metering \naccuracy in the SEL-311C.\n\nThe relay applies a small-signal cutoff threshold to the voltage and current \nsignals, and this can affect subsequent uses of the measurement.

This \nvoltage rise across the capacitor is analogous to the response of the thermal \ndemand meter in Figure 8.13 (middle) to the step current input (top).\nIn general, as voltage VC across the capacitor in Figure 8.14 cannot change \ninstantaneously, the thermal demand meter response is not immediate either \nfor the increasing or decreasing applied instantaneous current. The thermal \ndemand meter response time is based on the demand meter time constant \nsetting DMTC (see Table 8.4). Note in Figure 8.13, the thermal demand meter \nresponse (middle) is at 90 percent (0.9 per unit) of full applied value (1.0 per \nunit) after a time period equal to setting DMTC = 15 minutes, referenced to \nwhen the step current input is first applied.\n\nThe SEL-311C updates thermal demand values approximately every two seconds.\n\nRolling Demand Meter Response (EDEM = ROL)\nThe response of the rolling demand meter in Figure 8.13 (bottom) to the step \ncurrent input (top) is calculated with a sliding time-window arithmetic average \ncalculation. The width of the sliding time-window is equal to the demand \nmeter time constant setting DMTC (see Table 8.4). Note in Figure 8.13, the \nrolling demand meter response (bottom) is at 100 percent (1.0 per unit) of full \napplied value (1.0 per unit) after a time period equal to setting DMTC = 15 \nminutes, referenced to when the step current input is first applied.\n\nThe rolling demand meter integrates the applied signal (e.g., step current) \ninput in five-minute intervals. The integration is performed approximately \nevery two seconds. The average value for an integrated five-minute interval is \nderived and stored as a five-minute total. The rolling demand meter then \naverages a number of the five-minute totals to produce the rolling demand \nmeter response. In the Figure 8.13 example, the rolling demand meter \naverages the three latest five-minute totals because setting DMTC = 15 (15/5 \n= 3). The rolling demand meter response is updated every five minutes, after a \nnew five-minute total is calculated.\n\nThe following is a step-by-step calculation of the rolling demand response \nexample in Figure 8.13 (bottom).\n\nVS VC\n\n+\n\n+\n\n—\n\n—\n\nC\n\n\n\n8.22\n\nSEL-311C-2-3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nMetering and Monitoring\nDemand Metering\n\nTime = 0 Minutes\nPresume that the instantaneous current has been at zero for quite some time \nbefore “Time = 0 minutes” (or the demand meters were reset).

To avoid tripping on \nunbalance current IG, use Relay Word bit GDEM to detect the residual ground \n(unbalance) demand current IG(DEM) and effectively raise the pickup of the \nresidual ground time-overcurrent element 51GT. This is accomplished with \nthe following settings from Table 8.4, pertinent residual ground overcurrent \nelement settings, and SELOGIC control equation torque control setting \n51GTC.\n\nEDEM = THM\n\nDMTC = 5\n\nGDEMP = 1.0\n\n51GP = 1.50\n\n50G2P = 2.30\n\n51GTC = !GDEM + GDEM * 50G2\n\nRefer to Figure 8.15, Figure 8.16, and Figure 3.33.\n\nFigure 8.16 Raise Pickup of Residual Ground Time-Overcurrent Element for \nUnbalance Current\n\nResidual Ground Demand Current Below Pickup GDEMP\nWhen unbalance current IG is low, unbalance demand current IG(DEM) is \nbelow corresponding demand pickup GDEMP = 1.00 A secondary, and Relay \nWord bit GDEM is deasserted to logical 0.

Demand meters respond to more “slow moving” general trends.\n\nResidual Ground Demand Current Goes Above Pickup GDEMP\nWhen unbalance current IG increases, unbalance demand current IG(DEM) \nfollows, going above corresponding demand pickup GDEMP = 1.00 A \nsecondary, and Relay Word bit GDEM asserts to logical 1. This results in \nSELOGIC control equation torque control setting 51GTC being in the \nfollowing state.\n\n51GTC = !GDEM + GDEM * 50G2 = NOT(GDEM) + GDEM * 50G2 \n= NOT(logical 1) + (logical 1) * 50G2 = logical 0 + 50G2 = 50G2\n\nThus, the residual ground time-overcurrent element 51GT operates with an \neffective, less-sensitive pickup.\n\n50G2P = 2.30 A secondary\n\nThe reduced sensitivity keeps the residual ground time-overcurrent element \n51GT from tripping on higher unbalance current IG.\n\nResidual Ground Demand Current Goes Below Pickup GDEMP Again\nWhen unbalance current IG decreases again, unbalance demand current IG(DEM) \nfollows, going below corresponding demand pickup GDEMP = 1.00 A secondary, \nand Relay Word bit GDEM deasserts to logical 0.

These functions simulate analog meter drag-hands, with the \nmaximum value representing the upper drag-hand and the minimum value \nrepresenting the lower drag-hand.\n\nTable 8.5 shows the values that the relay would record for various power flow \ndirections (either MW3P or MVAR3P).\n\nNOTE: To avoid unexpected clearing \nof metering data, the proposed \nSELOGIC control equation should be \ntested to ensure it does not assert \nafter a group change or after relay \npower up.\n\nCurrents\n\nIA,B,C,N\nIG\n\nInput currents (A primary)\nResidual ground current (A primary; IG = 3I0)\n\nVoltages\n\nVA,B,C\nVS\n\nInput voltages (kV primary)\nInput voltage (kV primary)\n\nPower\n\nMW3P\nMVAR3P\n\nThree-phase megawatts\nThree-phase megavars\n\n\n\n8.29\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nMetering and Monitoring\nMaximum/Minimum Metering\n\nView or Reset Maximum/Minimum Metering Information\nVia Serial Port\n\nSee MET M—Maximum/Minimum Metering on page 10.55. The MET M \ncommand displays maximum/minimum metering values. The MET RM \ncommand resets the maximum/minimum metering values.\n\nVia Front Panel\nThe metering and reset functions available via serial port commands MET M \nand MET RM are also available via the front-panel METER pushbutton. See \nFigure 11.2.\n\nReset Via DNP or Modbus Control\nThe DNP binary output DRST_MML can be used to reset the Max/Min \nmetering, and is similar in function to the MET RM command. See \nAppendix L: DNP3 Communications for more details.\n\nThe Modbus protocol can be used to reset the Max/Min metering, with \nmethods that are similar in function to the MET RM command. Two methods \nare available:\n\n➤ Writing to the Reset Max/Min output coil.\n\n➤ Writing a specific analog value to the RSTDAT register.\n\nSee Appendix O: Modbus RTU and TCP Communications for details.\n\nReset Via SELOGIC Control Equation\nThe RST_MML SELOGIC control equation setting can be used to reset the \nMaximum/Minimum metering. The relay resets the function when the setting \nfirst asserts (rising edge, e.g., a logical 0 to a logical 1 transition).\n\nExample Application of RST_MML\nA control scheme requires Maximum/Minimum metering to be reset when \ncontrol input IN104 asserts, or when SV10T asserts.\n\nMake the logic settings in each settings group that will be used (e.g., use \nSET L 1, for setting group 1).\n\nRST_MML = /IN104 + /SV10T\n\nThe “/” rising edge operators ensure that a maintained logical 1 on IN104 does \nnot prevent SV10T from resetting the energy metering.\n\nTable 8.5 Operation of Maximum/Minimum Metering With Directional Power \nQuantitiesa\n\na For simplicity, the date and time stamps are not shown here.\n\nIf Power Varies\nRecorded MAX Recorded MIN\n\nFrom: To:\n\n9.7 16.2 16.2 9.7\n\n–4.2 1.4 1.4 –4.2\n\n–25.3 –17.4 –17.4 –25.3\n\n–6.2 27.4 27.4 –6.2\n\nNOTE: To avoid unexpected clearing \nof metering data, the proposed \nSELOGIC control equation should be \ntested to ensure it does not assert \nafter a group change or after relay \npower up.\n\n\n\n8.30\n\nSEL-311C-2-3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nMetering and Monitoring\nMaximum/Minimum Metering\n\nMaximum/Minimum \nMetering Update and \nStorage\n\nThe maximum/minimum metering function is intended to reflect normal load \nvariations rather than fault conditions or outages. Therefore, the SEL-311C \nupdates maximum/minimum values only if SELOGIC control equation setting \nFAULT is deasserted (= logical 0) and has been deasserted for at least \n3600 cycles.\n\nThe factory-default setting is set with time-overcurrent and distance element \npickups.\n\nFAULT = 51G + 51Q + M2P + Z2G\n\nIf there is a fault, 51G, 51Q, M2P, or Z2G asserts and blocks updating of \nmaximum/minimum metering values.\n\nIn addition to FAULT being deasserted for at least 3600 cycles, the following \nconditions must also be met.\n\n➤ For voltage values (VA, VB, VC, VS), the voltage is above the \ncorresponding threshold:\n\n25.0 V secondary (300 V voltage inputs)\n➤ For current values IA,B,C,N the current is above the \n\ncorresponding threshold:\n\n25.0 mA secondary (5 A nominal current inputs)\n5.0 mA secondary (1 A nominal current inputs)\n\n➤ For the residual current value IG:\n\nAll three phase currents IA, IB, IC are above threshold.\n\n➤ For power values MW3P and MVAR3P:\n\nAll three phase currents IA, IB, IC are above threshold and all \nthree voltages VA, VB, VC are above threshold.\n\n➤ The metering value is above the previous maximum or below \nthe previous minimum for approximately four seconds.\n\nThe SEL-311C stores maximum/minimum values to nonvolatile storage once \nper day and overwrites the previous stored value if that is exceeded. If the \nrelay loses control power, it will restore the maximum/minimum values saved \nat 23:50 hours on the previous day.\n\nNOTE: SELOGIC control equation \nsetting FAULT also controls other \nrelay functions; see SELOGIC Control \nEquation Setting FAULT on page 5.58.\n\nNOTE: The values used by the \nmaximum/minimum metering are the \nsame values used by the regular MET \ncommand (serial port or \ninstantaneous, front panel), which are \neight-cycle averaged values. The \nmaximum/minimum metering \nfunction updates every two seconds \n(approximately). These values should \nbe relatively immune to transient \nconditions.\n\n\n\n8.31\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nMetering and Monitoring\nSmall Signal Cutoff for Metering\n\nSmall Signal Cutoff for Metering\nThe current inputs to the energy meter and power demand meter are forced to \nzero while 52A = 0 if the metered current is less than 0.5 percent of nominal \ncurrent (25 mA for 5 A nominal, and 5 mA for 1 A nominal). This prevents \nthe energy meter from accumulating when the breaker is open and also allows \nthe power demand meter to eventually reset to zero.\n\nThe 0.5 percent threshold comparison is performed on a phase-by-phase basis. \nFor example, if IA is less than 0.5 percent of nominal current and 52A = 0, \nthen only the A-phase input to the energy and power demand calculations is \nforced to zero. The B- and C-phase inputs to the energy and power demand \ncalculations are not forced to zero.\n\nNo values are forced to zero when 52A = 1 even if the applied current is less \nthan 0.5 percent of nominal current.\n\nForcing the energy and power demand meter current input to zero does not \nimpact any other meter report and does not impact protection, event reporting, \nor synchrophasors.\n\nSynchrophasor Metering\nView Synchrophasor \nMetering Information \nVia Serial Port\n\nSee MET Command (Metering Data) on page 10.51.

For example, in the above list, \nthere are six “setting groups” for Group and Logic settings and five Port setting \ninstances, one for each communications port (except the optional USB port).\nSettings may be viewed or modified in several ways, as shown in Table 9.1.\n\nView settings with the respective serial port SHOW commands (SHO, SHO L, \nSHO G, SHO R, SHO T, SHO P). Because the SEL-311C only uses the first three \nletters of a command, SHOW can be shortened to SHO as above.\n\nSee SHO Command (Show/View Settings) on page 10.61 for examples of the \nSHO command, including the SEL-311C factory-default settings.\n\nThe SET command is described in a later subsection. Table 9.2 lists the \nsettings classes with a brief description, and the page numbers for the Settings \nSheets included at the end of this section. The order of the setting sheets \nmatches the numbered list, above.\n\nSee Front-Panel Pushbutton Operation on page 11.1 for details on accessing \nsettings via the front-panel HMI. \n\nSee Appendix C: PC Software for ACSELERATOR QuickSet® SEL-5030 \nSoftware information.\n\nTable 9.1 Methods of Accessing Settings\n\nSerial Port \nCommands\n\nFront-Panel \nInterface Set/\nShow Menu\n\nACSELERATOR \nQuickSet \n\nWeb\nServer\n\nDisplay Settings All settings \n(SHO command)\n\nSome settingsa\n\na Only Global, Group, and Port setting classes can be accessed using the front panel.\n\nAll settings All settings\n\nModify Settings All settings \n(SET command)\n\nSome settingsa All settings\n\nTable 9.2 Serial Port SET Commands \n\nCommand\nSettings \n\nType\nDescription\n\nSettings \nSheetsa\n\na Located at the end of this section.\n\nSET G Global Battery and breaker monitors, optoisolated \ninput debounce timers, synchrophasors, etc.\n\nSET.1–SET.6\n\nSET n Group Overcurrent and voltage elements, reclosing \nrelay, timers, etc., for settings Group n \n(n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n\nSET.7–SET.25\n\nSET L n Logic SELOGIC® control equations for settings \nGroup n (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n\nSET.26–SET.35\n\nSET R Report Sequential Events Recorder (SER) trigger \nconditions.\n\nSET.36\n\nSET T Text Front-panel default display and local \ncontrol text.\n\nSET.37–SET.40\n\nSET P n Port Port n settings\nn = 1: optional EIA-485 or fiber-optic serial \nport\n\nn = 2, 3, or F: EIA-232 serial ports\nn = 5: single or optional dual Ethernet\n\nSET.41–SET.53\n\nSET D n DNP DNP map n settings (n = 1, 2, or 3).

This software application is a \ngreat way to transfer settings between devices, or develop new settings based \non an existing settings database.\n\nRefer to Appendix C: PC Software for more information on using \nACSELERATOR QuickSet.\n\nSettings Changes Via \nthe Front Panel\n\nThe relay front-panel SET pushbutton provides view and modify access to the \nGlobal, Group, and Port settings only. Thus, the corresponding Global, Relay, \nand Port settings sheets that follow in this section can also be used when \nmaking these settings via the front panel. Refer to Front-Panel Pushbutton \nOperation on page 11.1 for information on the front-panel functions.\n\nSettings Changes Via \nthe Serial Port\n\nSee Section 10: Communications for information on serial port \ncommunications and relay access levels. The SET commands in Table 9.2 \noperate at Access Level 2 (screen prompt: =>>). To change a specific setting, \nenter the following command.\n\nSET c n s TERSE\n\nWhen you issue the SET command, the relay presents a list of settings, one at \na time. Enter a new setting, or press <Enter> to accept the existing setting. \nEditing keystrokes are shown in Table 9.3.\n\nwhere:\nc = class:\n\n(G, 1–6, L, R, T, P, D, or M) Choices 1–6 select the Group \n(relay) settings 1 through 6. If class is not specified, the relay \nselects the Group settings for the active settings group.\n\nn = instance number (only valid for class L, P, and D):\n➤ (1–6) for c = L (logic) class. If n is not specified, the relay \n\nselects the logic settings from the active settings group.\n➤ (1, 2, 3, 5, or F) for c = P (port) class. If n is not specified, \n\nthe relay selects the present port. If this session is via the \nUSB port, n must be specified.\n\n➤ (1–3) for c = D (DNP) class. If n is not specified, the relay \nselects DNP map 1.\n\ns = setting name to jump to at start of session.\nEnter the name of the setting you wish to jump to and begin \nsession. If s is not specified, the relay starts from the first \nsetting.\n\nTERSE = instructs the relay to skip the SHO display after the last \nsetting. Use this parameter to speed up the SET command. If \nyou wish to review the settings before saving, do not use the \nTERSE option.\n\n\n\n9.4\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nSetting the Relay\nIntroduction\n\nThe relay checks each entry to ensure that it is within the setting range. If it is \nnot, an Out of Range message is generated, and the relay prompts for the \nsetting again.\n\nAt the end of the setting session, the relay displays the new settings and \nprompts for approval to save them. Answer Y <Enter> to save the new \nsettings. The relay performs a final check of all settings, and if no problems \nare detected, the settings are saved to nonvolatile memory. If a problem is \ndetected, the settings are not saved and the relay indicates a setting that needs \nattention. This final check ensures that settings from every class are \ncompatible with the recent settings edit.\n\nSettings Change \nConfirmation\n\nIf changes are made to Global, Report, or Text settings, or to the Group or \nLogic settings for the active settings group (see Table 9.2), the relay is \ndisabled for less than two seconds while it saves the new settings. The EN LED \nextinguishes (see Table 5.6) while the relay is disabled. Relay Word bit \nSETCHG pulses for approximately one second to indicate that the settings \nhave changed.\n\nIf changes are made to the Group or Logic settings for a settings group other \nthan the active settings group, or to Port, DNP maps, or Modbus map settings \n(see Table 9.2), the relay is not disabled while it saves the new settings. Relay \nWord bit SETCHG pulses for approximately one second, but the EN LED \nremains on (see Table 5.6) while the new settings are saved.\n\nTable 9.3 SET Command Editing Keystrokes\n\nPress Key(s) Results\n\n<Enter> Retains setting and moves to the next setting.\n\n^ <Enter> Returns to previous setting.\n\n< <Enter> Returns to previous setting section.\n\n> <Enter> Moves to next setting section.\n\nEnd <Enter> Exits editing session, then prompts you to save the settings.\n\n<Ctrl+X> Aborts editing session without saving changes.\n\n\\<Enter> Allows text entry to be continued on next line. The \\ symbol must \nappear at the end of a line, just before pressing <Enter>.\n\n\n\n9.5\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nSetting the Relay\nTime-Overcurrent Curves\n\nTime-Overcurrent Curves\nThe following information describes the curve timing for the curve and time-\ndial settings made for the time-overcurrent elements (see Figure 3.32–\nFigure 3.34).

Relay\nSettings Explanations\n\nSettings Explanations\nNote that most of the settings in the settings sheets that follow include references for \nadditional information. The following explanations are for settings that do not have \nreference information anywhere else in the instruction manual.\n\nIdentifier Labels Refer to Identifier Labels on page SET.7.\nThe SEL-311C Relay has two identifier labels.\n\n➤ Relay Identifier (RID)\n➤ Terminal Identifier (TID)\n\nThe Relay Identifier is typically used to identify the relay or the type of \nprotection scheme. Typical Terminal Identifiers include an abbreviation of the \nsubstation name and line terminal.\n\nThe relay tags each report (event report, meter report, etc.) with the Relay \nIdentifier and Terminal Identifier. This allows you to distinguish the report as \none generated for a specific breaker and substation.\n\nRID and TID settings may include the following characters: 0–9, A–Z, -, /, ., \nspace. These two settings cannot be made via the front-panel interface.\n\nCurrent Transformer \nRatios\n\nRefer to Current and Potential Transformer Ratios on page SET.7.\nPhase and neutral current transformer ratios are set independently. If neutral \nchannel IN is connected residually with IA, IB, and IC, then set CTR and CTRN \nthe same. Relay settings CTR and CTRN are used in relay event reports and \nmetering functions to scale secondary current quantities into primary values.\n\nSettings for Voltage \nInput Configuration\n\nVNOM = (25.00–300.00 V sec) selects the nominal system voltage, as seen by the \nrelay inputs VA, VB, VC, and N in V secondary. The relay uses this setting to determine \nthe thresholds for the loss-of-potential logic, and the exact value entered does not \naffect metering or protection accuracy. The default value is 67.00 V.\n\nPotential Transformer \nRatios and PT \nNominal Secondary \nVoltage Settings\n\nRefer to Current and Potential Transformer Ratios on page SET.7.\nRelay setting PTR is the overall potential ratio from the primary system to the \nrelay phase voltage inputs VA, VB, VC, and N. For example, on a 12.5 kV \nphase-to-phase primary system with wye-connected 7200:120 V PTs, the \ncorrect PTR setting is 60.\n\nRelay setting PTRS is the overall potential ratio from the synchronizing \nvoltage source to the relay VS-NS voltage inputs. For example, with phase-to-\nground voltage connected from a 12.5 kV phase-to-phase primary system \nthrough a 7200:120 V PT, the correct PTRS setting is 60.\n\nSettings PTR and PTRS are used in event report and METER commands so \nthat power system values can be reported in primary units.\n\nRelay setting VNOM is the nominal secondary voltage connected to voltage \ninputs VA-VB–VC-N.\n\nFor example, for a 10 kV (phase-to-phase) system with wye-connected PTs \nrated 7200:120 V (PTR = 60), the setting for VNOM would be as follows.\n\n10000 V/ ( 3 • 60) = 96.22 V\n\n\n\n9.17\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nSetting the Relay\nSettings Explanations\n\nIn the loss-of-potential logic (see Figure 4.1 and accompanying text), setting VNOM \nscales certain voltage thresholds for voltage measurement comparisons.\n\nTime and Date \nManagement Settings\n\nThe SEL-311C supports several methods of updating the relay date and time. \n\nFor IRIG-B and Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) synchrophasor \napplications, refer to Configuring High-Accuracy Timekeeping on page N.27.\nFor Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) applications, refer to Simple \nNetwork Time Protocol (SNTP) on page 10.20.\nFor time update from a DNP Master, see Time Synchronization on page L.9.\n\nCoordinated \nUniversal Time (UTC) \nOffset Setting\n\nThe SEL-311C has a Global setting UTC_OFF, settable from –24.00 to 24.00 \nhours, in 0.01 hour increments. \n\nThe relay HTTP (Web) Server uses the UTC_OFF setting to calculate UTC \ntimestamps in request headers.\n\nThe relay also uses the UTC_OFF setting to calculate local (relay) time from \nthe UTC source when configured for Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) \nupdating via Ethernet. When a time source other than SNTP is updating the \nrelay time, the UTC_OFF setting is not considered because the other time \nsources are defined as local time. When using IEEE C37.118 compliant \nIRIG-B signals (e.g., Global setting IRIGC = C37.118), the relay uses the \nUTC to local time offset provided as part of the time message to determine the \nlocal time. If the IRIG signal is lost, Global setting UTC_OFF will be used.\n\nSet UTC_OFF properly even if you expect some other time source, such as \nIRIG-B, to correct for the offset. If the time source fails, the relay will revert to \nSNTP or internal time, and UTC_OFF will allow the relay to record and report \nthe correct local time. If UTC_OFF is not set properly, some relay reports may \nshow unexpected results.\n\nAutomatic Daylight-\nSaving Time Settings\n\nThe SEL-311C can automatically switch to and from daylight-saving time, as \nspecified by the eight Global settings DST_BEGM through DST_ENDH. The \nfirst four settings control the month, week, day, and time that daylight-saving \ntime shall commence, while the last four settings control the month, week, \nday, and time that daylight-saving time shall cease.\n\nOnce configured, the SEL-311C will change to and from daylight-saving time \nevery year at the specified time. Device Word bit DST asserts when daylight \nsaving time is active.\n\nThe SEL-311C interprets the week number settings DST_BEGW and \nDST_ENDW (1–3, L = Last) as follows.\n\n➤ The first seven days of the month are considered to be in week 1. \n\n➤ The second seven days of the month are considered to be in week 2.\n\n➤ The third seven days of the month are considered to be in week 3.\n\n➤ The last seven days of the month are considered to be in week “L.”\n\nThis method of counting of the weeks allows easy programming of statements \nlike “the first Sunday,” “the second Saturday,” or “the last Tuesday” of a month.\n\n\n\n9.18\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nSetting the Relay\nSettings Explanations\n\nAs an example, consider the following settings:\nDST_BEGM = 3\n\nDST_BEGW = L\n\nDST_BEGD = SUN\n\nDST_BEGH = 2\n\nDST_ENDM = 10\n\nDST_ENDW = 3\n\nDST_ENDD = WED\n\nDST_ENDH = 3\n\nWith these example settings, the relay will enter daylight-saving time on the \nlast Sunday in March at 0200 h, and leave daylight-saving time on the third \nWednesday in October at 0300 h. The relay asserts Relay Word bit DST when \ndaylight-saving time is active.\n\nWhen an IRIG-B time source is being used, the relay time follows the IRIG-B \ntime, including daylight-saving time start and end, as commanded by the time \nsource. If there is a discrepancy between the daylight-saving time settings and \nthe received IRIG-B signal, the relay follows the IRIG-B signal.\n\nWhen using IEEE C37.118 compliant IRIG-B signals (e.g., Global setting \nIRIGC = C37.118), the relay automatically populates the DST Relay Word bit, \nregardless of the daylight-saving time settings. \n\nWhen using regular IRIG-B signals (e.g., Global setting IRIGC = NONE), the \nrelay only populates the DST Relay Word bit if the daylight-saving time \nsettings are properly configured. \n\nSet daylight savings times properly even if you expect some other time source, \nsuch as IRIG-B, to correct for daylight savings time offset. The relay relies on \nthese settings for correct time should the time source fail (for IRIGC = \nC37.118) and to calculate UTC time correctly (when IRIGC = NONE). If \ndaylight savings time settings are not correct, some relay reports may show \nunexpected results. Use the TIME DST command to confirm the daylight-\nsaving time settings and status.\n\nLine Settings Refer to Line Settings on page SET.7.\nLine impedance settings Z1MAG, Z1ANG, Z0MAG, and Z0ANG are used in \nthe fault locator (see Fault Location on page 12.7 and Fault Location on \npage R.1) and in automatically making directional element settings Z2F, Z2R, \nZ0F, and Z0R (see Settings Made Automatically on page 4.29). A \ncorresponding line length setting (LL) is also used in the fault locator.\nZ0ANG must be set to the actual zero-sequence line angle to allow correct \nfault locator operation for forward faults involving ground.\n\nThe line impedance settings Z1MAG and Z0MAG are set in  secondary. \nLine impedance ( primary) is converted to  secondary.\n\n primary • (CTR/PTR) =  secondary\nwhere:\n\nCTR = phase (IA, IB, IC) current transformer ratio\nPTR = phase (VA, VB, VC) potential transformer ratio\n\n\n\n9.19\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nSetting the Relay\nSettings Explanations\n\nLine length setting LL is unitless and corresponds to the line impedance \nsettings. For example, if a particular line length is 15 miles, enter the line \nimpedance values ( secondary) and then enter the corresponding line length.\n\nLL = 15.00 (miles)\nIf this length of line is measured in kilometers rather than miles, then enter.\n\nLL = 24.14 (kilometers)\n\nEnable Settings Refer to Global Settings (Serial Port Command SET G and Front Panel) on \npage SET.1 and Group n (Relay) Settings (Serial Port Command SET n and \nFront Panel) on page SET.7.\nThe SEL-311C includes enable settings in the Global, Group, and Port \nsettings classes. Several of these enable settings help limit the number of \nsettings that must be entered when a feature is not required.\n\nGlobal Enable Settings\nThe Global settings class contains three enable settings. These settings control \nother Global settings as follows.\n\n➤ EBMON: Breaker Monitor (Y, N). Hides six settings when set \nto N.\n\n➤ EPMU: Synchronized Phasor Measurement (Y, N). Hides as \nmany as 21 settings when set to N. Also affects Port enable \nsettings PROTO and EPMIP.\n\n➤ DST_BEGM: Month to Begin DST (NA, 1–12). Hides seven \nsettings when set to NA.\n\nGroup (Relay) Enable Settings\nEach Group settings class contains as many as 29 enable settings, depending \non model. See Group n (Relay) Settings (Serial Port Command SET n and \nFront Panel) on page SET.7 for a full listing of the relay settings, and \nassociated enable settings. The Relay enable settings are as follows.\n\n➤ EADVS: Advanced Settings.\n\n➤ E21P, E21MG, E21XG: Distance Elements\n\n➤ E50P, E50G, E50Q: Instantaneous/Definite-Time Overcurrent \nElements\n\n➤ E51P, E51G, E51Q: Time-Overcurrent Elements\n➤ E50BF: Breaker Failure\n\n➤ E32: Directional Control\n\n➤ EOOS: Out-of-Step\n\n➤ ELOAD: Load Encroachment\n\n➤ ESOTF and EDDSOTF: Switch-Onto-Fault\n\n➤ EVOLT: Voltage Elements\n\n➤ E25: Synchronism Check\n\n➤ EFLOC: Fault Location (does not hide any settings)\n➤ ELOP and EBBPT: Loss-Of-Potential\n\n➤ ECOMM: Communications-Assisted Trip Scheme\n\n\n\n9.20\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nSetting the Relay\nSettings Explanations\n\n➤ E81: Frequency Elements\n\n➤ E79: Reclosures\n\n➤ EZ1EXT, EZ1EXTP, EZ1EXTG: Zone 1 extension\n\n➤ ECCVT: CCVT Transient Detection\n\n➤ ESV: SELOGIC Variable/Timers\n\n➤ EDEM: Demand Metering (does not hide any settings)\n\nPort Enable Settings\nEach Port settings class contains as many as five enable settings. These \nsettings control other Port settings as follows.\n\nSerial Port Settings (Port 1, 2, 3, or F)\n➤ EPORT: Enable Port (Y, N). Disables the port and hides all port \n\nsettings when set to N. The EPORT setting for Port F controls \nboth the front-panel EIA-232 serial port F and the optional \nUSB port.\n\n➤ PROTO: Protocol. Controls availability of subsequent settings. \nWhen PROTO is set to SEL or LMD, another enable setting \nappears:\n\nMAXACC: Maximum Access Level (0, 1, B, 2, C). Selects \nhighest access level allowed on port by limiting the availability \nof commands ACC, BAC, 2AC, or CAL. The MAXACC for \nPort F (only) can be set to 1, B, 2, or C and affects both serial \nport F and the optional USB port.\n\nEthernet Port Settings (Port 5)\n➤ EPORT: Enable Port (Y,N). Hides all port settings when set to N. \n➤ ETELNET: Enable Telnet (Y,N). Hides five settings when set \n\nto N. When ETELNET is set to Y, another enable setting \nappears:\n\nMAXACC: Maximum Access Level (0, 1, B, 2, C). \nSelects highest access level allowed on a Telnet session by \nlimiting the availability of commands ACC, BAC, 2AC, \nor CAL. \n\n➤ EFTPSERV: Enable FTP (Y, N). Hides three settings when set to N.\n➤ EHTTP: Enable HTTP Server (Y, N). Hides five settings when set \n\nto N. When EHTTP is set to Y, another enable setting appears: \nHTTPACC: HTTP Maximum Access Level (1,2). Selects \nhighest access level allowed over the Web Server interface.\n\n➤ E61850: Enable IEC 61850 Protocol (Y, N). Hides one setting \nwhen set to N (setting only present on relays ordered with \nIEC 61850).\n\n➤ EDNP: Enable DNP Sessions (0–6). Controls availability of \nsubsequent settings (as many as 31 settings per session).\n\n➤ EPMIP: Enable PMU Processing (Y,N). Controls availability \nof as many as six subsequent settings.\n\nNOTE: The Access jumper overrides \nthe EPORT = N setting for the front-\npanel ports. Installing the Access \njumper also causes the front-panel \nEIA-232 port to revert to factory-\ndefault settings for PROTO, SPEED, \nBITS, PARITY, STOP, and RTSCTS when \nEPORT = N.\n\nNOTE: The Access jumper overrides \nthe MAXACC setting for any enabled \nports, and allows the highest access \nlevel (C = Calibration).\n\nNOTE: When ETELNET = Y, the \nAccess jumper overrides the MAXACC \nsetting, and allows the Telnet \nsession(s) to attain the highest access \nlevel (C = Calibration).\n\n\n\n9.21\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nSetting the Relay\nSettings Sheets\n\n➤ EMODBUS: Enable Modbus (0–3). Controls availability of as \nmany as seven subsequent settings.\n\n➤ ESNTP: Enable SNTP client (OFF, UNICAST, MANYCAST, \nBROADCAST). Controls availability of as many as five \nsubsequent settings.\n\nPC Software\nThese enable settings are also present in the SEL-311C driver for \nACSELERATOR QuickSet SEL-5030 (PC software). The effect of changing an \nenable setting is easy to see, because the associated setting field turns grey \nwhen it is unavailable. See Appendix C: PC Software for more information on \nACSELERATOR QuickSet.\n\nOptional USB Port\nNo port settings are required for the optional USB port. However, the USB \nport is controlled by the previously described Port F (front-panel EIA-232 \nserial port) settings EPORT and MAXACC. \nThe PC operating system should prompt for a USB driver when a PC is \nconnected to the relay. See Establishing Communications Using the USB Port \non page 10.2 for further details on using the USB port.\n\nOther System \nParameters\n\nRefer to Power System Configuration and Date Format on page SET.1.\nThe Global settings NFREQ and PHROT allow you to configure the \nSEL-311C to your specific system.\n\nSet NFREQ equal to your nominal power system frequency, either 50 Hz or \n60 Hz.\n\nSet PHROT equal to your power system phase rotation, either ABC or ACB.\n\nSet DATE_F to format the date displayed in relay reports and the front-panel \ndisplay. Set DATE_F to MDY to display dates in Month/Day/Year format; set \nDATE_F to YMD to display dates in Year/Month/Day format.\n\nSettings Sheets\nThe settings sheets that follow include the definition and input range for each \nsetting in the relay.

Use the communications ports to establish local and remote \ncommunications with the relay using numerous communications protocols.\n\nThe first part of this section shows how to establish local communications \nwith the relay using serial, USB, Ethernet ports and the SEL ASCII \ncommunications protocol, or the built-in web server. Other parts of this \nsection provide reference information to help you use relay communications \nports to establish local and remote communications for engineering access, \nSCADA communications, teleprotection, and synchrophasor data collection. \nUse of actual communications protocols such as IEC 61850, DNP, Modbus®, \nor SEL MIRRORED BITS® is covered in various appendices of this manual.\n\nEstablishing \nCommunications \nUsing a Serial Port\n\nUse the front serial port and any terminal emulation program or the \nACSELERATOR QuickSet® SEL-5030 Software to begin communicating \nwith the relay. Connect SEL cable C234A between the relay and a personal \ncomputer. The serial port default communications parameters are listed below:\n\n➤ Baud Rate = 9600\n\n➤ Data Bits = 8\n\n➤ Parity = N\n\n➤ Stop Bits = 1\n\nUse the SET P command to change the relay communications port \nparameters.\n\nTable 10.1 SEL-311C Communications Ports\n\nPort \nNumber\n\nType Location\nStandard/ \nOptional\n\n1 EIA-485 Serial or SEL-2812 Compatible Fiber Optic Rear Optional\n\n2 EIA-232 Serial Rear Standard\n\n3 EIA-232 Serial Rear Standard\n\n4 or F EIA-232 Serial Front Standard\n\n5 Single Ethernet Rear Standard\n\n5A/5B Dual Ethernet Rear Optional\n\nN/A USB Front Optional\n\n\n\n10.2\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nCommunications\nIntroduction\n\nEstablishing Communications Using the USB Port\nUSB Port Overview\n\nThe USB port has no settings, and is faster than the serial ports, especially for \noperations requiring transport of large blocks of data such as long event \nreports or firmware upgrades.\n\nEach time you connect a relay to your PC USB port, Windows determines if a \ndriver has already been installed and is ready for use. There are three possibilities.\n\n1. Connect a PC for the first time to a relay USB port.\nWindows launches the Found New Hardware \nWizard. The wizard guides you through the USB driver \ninstallation process and creates a new virtual COM port \n(e.g., COM 4).\nSee Detailed Instructions for USB Port Driver \nInstallation on page 10.3 below before connecting the \nrelay to your PC USB port. \n\n2. Reconnect a PC to a relay USB port using a different physical \nUSB port on a PC (i.e., same PC, different physical USB port \non the PC).\n\nWindows launches the Found New Hardware \nWizard. Select Install the software automatically \n(Recommended) and click Next. Windows locates the \nrequired INF file and driver, and creates a new virtual \nCOM port (e.g., COM 5).\nWindows creates a new virtual COM port (e.g., COM 6, \nCOM 7) each time you connect a relay to a physical \nUSB port that has not previously been connected to a \nrelay. The virtual COM port number remains associated \nwith the same physical USB port until you uninstall the \ndriver.\n\n3. Reconnect a PC to a relay USB port using a physical USB port \non the PC that has already been connected to a relay (i.e., same \nPC, same physical USB port on the PC).\n\nWindows recognizes that the driver is already installed, \nand creates the same virtual COM port created the first \ntime you connected a relay to that particular physical USB \nport (e.g., COM 4). No action is required on your part.\n\nThe USB driver exposes normal communications port settings to the personal \ncomputer operating system, such as baud rate, parity, etc. to maintain \ncompatibility with many PC applications. Changing these settings in the PC \ndoes not change how the relay USB port operates. You may use a PC Terminal \nEmulator program or dedicated software to connect to the SEL-311C via USB \nport. The USB port offers a subset of the functionality of a standard serial \nport—see Table 10.7 for details.\n\nUSB uses a connection based protocol. Under certain circumstances, such as \npower cycling the relay, the USB connection may be terminated. If the USB \nconnection is terminated it may be necessary to reconnect to the relay using \nthe PC application software, or disconnect and then reconnect the USB \nconnector at either the PC or the relay.\n\n\n\n10.3\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nCommunications\nIntroduction\n\nACSELERATOR QuickSet is more tolerant to unexpected USB device \ndisconnections than most other PC applications. While using ACSELERATOR \nQuickSet, it is possible to disconnect the USB cable from one relay and move \nit to another relay without the need to restart the application, reselect the COM \nport, or even disconnect and reconnect at the application level.\n\nDetailed Instructions for USB Port Driver Installation\nThe following detailed instructions for USB driver installation are specifically \nfor the Windows XP operating system.   Some steps may be different and \nsome screens may be changed for other Windows operating systems. \n\nStep 1. Retrieve the USB driver file “SEL Fast CDC USB Device.INF” \nfrom the SEL-311C product page on the SEL website \n(www.selinc.com), from the SEL-311C Product Literature CD, \nor from the ACSELERATOR QuickSet SEL-5030 Installation \nCD. Place the INF file in any convenient directory, such as \nC:\\SEL\\Drivers\\Relay_USB.\n\nStep 2. Connect the relay to your PC with SEL Cable C664, or any \nstandard A to B USB cable. Your PC will recognize that a new \ndevice has been connected, and will start the Found New \nHardware Wizard. Select No, not this time and click Next. \nSome Windows XP systems will skip this screen and go to the \nscreen shown in Step 3.\n\nNOTE: The SEL-311 USB driver is \ndifferent than the driver used for SEL \nEIA-232 serial to USB converter cable \nC662, and is different from the driver \nused for the SEL-2440 Discrete \nProgrammable Automation Controller.\n\n\n\n10.4\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nCommunications\nIntroduction\n\nStep 3. Select Install from a list or specific location (Advanced). \nClick Next.\n\nStep 4. Select Don’t search. I will choose the driver to install. \nClick Next.\n\n\n\n10.5\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nCommunications\nIntroduction\n\nStep 5. If prompted for a hardware type select Ports (COM & LPT) \nand click Next. Some Windows XP systems will skip this \nscreen and go to the next screen.\n\nStep 6. If necessary, use the Have Disk button and direct the wizard to \nthe folder containing the INF file you copied to your local drive \nin Step 1. After you locate the INF file, the Found New \nHardware Wizard will return to the screen shown below. \nVerify the selected Model is SEL Fast USB CDC Device. \nClick Next.\n\nStep 7. If Windows warns that the driver has not passed Windows Logo \ntesting, verify that the name SEL Fast CDC USB Device \nmatches the Model selected in Step 6, and then click Continue \nAnyway.\n\nStep 8. Wait while the wizard installs the driver software.\n\n\n\n10.6\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nCommunications\nIntroduction\n\nStep 9. Click Finish to finish the installation process.\n\nThe USB port driver is now installed, and a new virtual COM port (e.g., \nCOM 4) is ready for use. To see what virtual COM port has been created, \nlaunch any communications program that allows selection of a COM port, and \nview the available ports, or go to the Windows Device Manager and inspect \nthe available COM ports as shown below. Use Device Manager to verify \nwhich virtual COM port is associated with a particular physical USB port. \nDevice Manager updates the available COM ports each time a cable is inserted \nor removed.\n\nTo test the USB port and the newly installed driver follow the steps below.\n\nStep 1. Launch ACSELERATOR QuickSet, and select \nCommunications > Parameters from the menu, or click the \nCommunications Parameters icon from the opening screen. \nSee Appendix C: PC Software for more information on \nACSELERATOR QuickSet. Select the new COM port created by \nthe driver installation process, e.g., COM 4 in the screen \n\n\n\n10.7\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nCommunications\nIntroduction\n\ncapture. Ignore other settings like parity and baud rate. They \nhave no effect on how the USB port operates, and are only \npresented to the operating system to retain compatibility with \ncertain applications.\n\nStep 2. Select Communications > Terminal from the menu, or click \nthe terminal icon on the tool bar. Log into the relay normally. \nThe USB port should work similarly to an EIA-232 port, only \nmuch faster. See Table 10.7 for a list of features available from \nthe USB port.\n\nEstablishing \nCommunications \nUsing an Ethernet \nPort and Telnet or the \nWeb Server\n\nFactory-default settings for the Ethernet ports disable all Ethernet protocols \nexcept PING. Enable the Telnet and web server protocols with the SET P 5 \ncommand using any of the serial ports or the USB port. Command SET P 5 \naccesses settings for all Ethernet ports on the SEL-311C relay: Port 5, Port 5A \nand Port 5B.\n\nSee SHO Command (Show/View Settings) on page 10.61 for a sample of the \nSHO 5 command, with factory-default settings. See Port 5 Settings (for \nEthernet Port 5, or 5A and 5B) (Serial Port SET P 5 Command) on \npage SET.47 for the Port 5 settings sheets.\n\nMake the following settings using the SET P 5 command.\n➤ IPADDR = IP Address assigned by network administrator\n\n➤ SUBNETM = Subnet mask assigned by network administrator\n\n➤ DEFRTR = Default router IP Address assigned by network \nadministrator\n\nNOTE: Telnet and the web server work with other NETMODE settings also, but NETMODE = \nSWITCHED is easiest to begin communications. The relay hides setting NETMODE when equipped \nwith a single Ethernet port. \n\n➤ NETMODE = SWITCHED (available with dual Ethernet \nports)\n\n➤ ETELNET = Y\n\n➤ EHTTP = Y\n\nLeave all other settings at their default values.\n\nConnect an Ethernet cable between your PC or a network switch and any \nEthernet port on the relay. Verify that the amber Link LED illuminates on the \nconnected relay port. Many computers and most Ethernet switches support \nautomatic crossover, so nearly any CAT5 Ethernet cable with RJ45 \nconnectors, such as SEL cable C627 will work. When the computer does not \nsupport automatic crossover, use a crossover cable, such as SEL cable C628. \nFor fiber-optic Ethernet ports use SEL cable C807 62.5 m fiber optic cable \nwith LC connectors. If your relay is equipped with dual Ethernet ports, \nconnect to either port. Use a Telnet application or ACSELERATOR QuickSet on \nthe host PC to communicate with the relay. To terminate a Telnet session, use \nthe command EXI <Enter> from any access level.\n\nLaunch a web browser and browse address http://IPADDR, where IPADDR is \nthe Port 5 IPADDR setting. To terminate the session, simply close the web \nbrowser.\n\nNOTE: The host portion of the IP \naddress cannot be set to all 0s or 1s.\n\n\n\n10.8\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nCommunications\nIntroduction\n\nEthernet Port Speed\nChange the speed of 10/100BASE-T copper Ethernet ports using Port setting \nNET5SPD for relays equipped with one 10/100BASE-T Ethernet port and \nsettings NET5ASPD and NET5BSPD for relays equipped with two \n10/100BASE-T Ethernet ports. Port speed is fixed at 100 Mbps for all copper \nand fiber-optic ports in relays with one or more 100BASE-FX Ethernet ports.\n\nUsing Redundant \nEthernet Ports\n\nThe SEL-311C is optionally equipped with two 10/100BASE-T copper \nEthernet ports, two 100BASE-FX fiber-optic Ethernet ports, or one \n10/100BASE-T and one 100BASE-FX port. Use two Ethernet ports in \nredundant network architectures, or force the relay to use a single Ethernet \nport even though it is equipped with two ports.\n\nRedundant Ethernet Network Using SWITCHED Mode\nMake Port 5 setting NETMODE = SWITCHED to activate the internal \nEthernet switch. The internal switch connects a single Ethernet stack inside \nthe relay to the two external Ethernet ports. The combination of relay and \ninternal switch operate the same as if a single Ethernet port on a relay were \nconnected to an external unmanaged Ethernet switch. Use the internal switch \nto create “self-healing rings” as shown in Figure 10.1.\n\nFigure 10.1 Self-Healing Ring Using Internal Ethernet Switch\n\nUsing this topology the network can still connect to any relay even if another \nrelay, cable, or switch fails. The external managed network switches select \nwhich of the two relay Ethernet ports are used for what purpose. That \nselection is invisible to the relay, and does not require special relay \nconfiguration, other than making setting NETMODE = SWITCHED. \n\nRedundant Ethernet Network Using FAILOVER Mode\nMake the following settings in Port 5 to configure the relay for FAILOVER mode.\n\n➤ NETMODE = FAILOVER\n\n➤ FTIME = desired timeout for the active port before failover to \nthe backup port (0.10–65.00 seconds and OFF)\n\n➤ NETPORT = the preferred network interface (A for Port 5A, \nB for Port 5B)\n\nUse the internal failover switch to connect the relay to redundant networks as \nshown in Figure 10.2.\n\nSEL-311 SEL-311 SEL-311 SEL-311 SEL-311\n\nNetwork\n\nManaged\nEthernet\nSwitch\n\nManaged\nEthernet\nSwitch\n\n\n\n10.9\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nCommunications\nIntroduction\n\nFigure 10.2 Failover Network Topology\n\nOn startup the relay communicates using the primary network interface \nselected by the NETPORT setting. If the relay detects a link failure on the \nprimary interface, and the link status on the standby interface is healthy, the \nrelay activates the standby network interface after time FTIME. If the link \nstatus on the primary interface returns to normal before time FTIME, the \nfailover timer resets and operation continues on the primary network interface.\n\nSetting FTIME = OFF allows fast port switching (with no intentional delay). \nFast port switching can occur within one processing interval (typically 4 ms to \n5 ms) and can help with IEC 61850 GOOSE performance.\nAfter failover, while communicating via the standby interface, if the relay \ndetects a link failure on the standby interface, and the link status on the \nprimary interface is healthy, the relay activates the primary network interface \nafter time FTIME. The choice of active port is reevaluated after settings \nchange, and after relay restart.\n\nNetwork \nConnection Using \nFixed Connection \nMode\n\nForce the relay to use a single Ethernet port even when it is equipped with two \nEthernet ports by making settings NETMODE = FIXED. When NETMODE = \nFIXED, only the interface selected by NETPORT is active. The other interface \nis disabled.\n\nNetwork \nConnection Using \nPRP Connection Mode\n\nParallel Redundancy Protocol (PRP) is part of an IEC standard for high \navailability automation networks (IEC 62439-3). The purpose of the protocol \nis to provide seamless recovery from any single Ethernet network failure.\n\nThe basic concept is that the Ethernet network and all traffic are fully \nduplicated with the two copies operating in parallel.\n\nMake the following settings in Port 5 to configure the relay for PRP mode.\n➤ NETMODE := PRP\n\n➤ PRPTOUT := desired timeout for PRP frame entry\n\n➤ PRPADDR := PRP destination MAC address LSB \n01-15-4E-00-01-XX\n\n➤ PRPINTV := desired supervision frame transmit interval\n\nSEL-311\n\nSEL-311\n\nSEL-311\n\nNetwork\n\nSEL-2725 SEL-2725\n\n\n\n10.10\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nCommunications\nPort Connector and Communications Cables\n\nWhen NETMODE is not set to PRP, the following settings are hidden.\n\nEthernet Status \nRelay Word Bits\n\nThe SEL-311C Ethernet status is available through the Relay Word bits shown \nin Table 10.3.\n\nPort Connector and Communications Cables\nHardware \nHandshaking\n\nAll EIA-232 serial ports support RTS/CTS hardware handshaking. RTS/CTS \nhandshaking is not supported on the optional Serial Port 1.\n\nTo enable hardware handshaking, use the SET P command (or front-panel SET \npushbutton) to set RTSCTS = Y. Disable hardware handshaking by setting \nRTSCTS = N.\n\n➤ If RTSCTS = N, the relay permanently asserts the RTS line.\n\n➤ If RTSCTS = Y, the relay deasserts RTS when it is unable to \nreceive characters.\n\n➤ If RTSCTS = Y, the relay does not send characters until the \nCTS input is asserted.\n\nTable 10.2 PRP Settings \n\nSetting Name Range Units\nDefault \nValue\n\nSetting Description\n\nPRPTOUT 400–10000 ms 500 PRP Entry Timeout\n\nPRPADDR 0–255 00 The multicast MAC address of \nPRP supervision frames is \n01-15-4E-00-01-XX where XX \nis specified by this setting.\n\nPRPINTV 1–10 seconds 2 PRP Supervision TX Interval\n\nTable 10.3 Ethernet Status Indicators \n\nRelay Word Bit Available by Relay Model Description Valid When\n\nLINK5 Single Ethernet Asserts when a valid \nEthernet link is \ndetected on Port 5\n\nPort 5 setting \nEPORT = Y\n\nLINK5A Dual Ethernet Asserts when a valid \nEthernet link is \ndetected on Port 5A\n\nPort 5 setting \nEPORT = Y\n\nLINK5B Dual Ethernet Asserts when a valid \nEthernet link is \ndetected on Port 5B\n\nPort 5 setting \nEPORT = Y\n\nLNKFAIL Single or Dual Ethernet Asserts when the \nactive port is down\n\nPort 5 setting \nEPORT = Y\n\nP5ASEL Dual Ethernet Asserts when \nPort 5A is selected\n\nPort 5 setting \nNETMODE = \nFAILOVER\n\nP5BSEL Dual Ethernet Asserts when \nPort 5B is selected\n\nPort 5 setting \nNETMODE = \nFAILOVER\n\n\n\n10.11\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nCommunications\nPort Connector and Communications Cables\n\nCommunications Port \nPinouts\n\nFigure 10.3 and Table 10.4 through Table 10.6 show the functions of the pins \nand terminals of the serial ports.\n\nFigure 10.3 DB-9 Connector Pinout for EIA-232 Serial Ports\n\nTable 10.4 Pinout Functions for EIA-232 Serial Ports 2, 3, and F\n\nPin PORT 2 PORT 3 PORT F\n\n1 N/C or +5 Vdca\n\na See EIA-232 Serial Port Voltage Jumpers on page 2.30.\n\nN/C or +5 Vdca N/C\n\n2 RXD RXD RXD\n\n3 TXD TXD TXD\n\n4 +IRIG-B N/C N/C\n\n5, 9 GND GND GND\n\n6 –IRIG-B N/C N/C\n\n7 RTS RTS RTS\n\n8 CTS CTS CTS\n\nTable 10.5 Terminal Functions for EIA-485 Serial Port 1 \n\nTerminal Function\n\n1 +TX\n\n2 –TX\n\n3 +RX\n\n4 –RX\n\n5 SHIELD\n\nTable 10.6 Serial Communications Port Pin/Terminal Function Definitions \n\nPin Function Definition\n\nN/C No Connection\n\n+5 Vdc (0.5 A combined limit) 5 Vdc Power Connection\nRXD, RX Receive Data\n\nTXD, TX Transmit Data\n\nIRIG-B IRIG-B Time-Code Input\n\nGND Ground\n\nSHIELD Shielded Ground\n\nRTS Request To Send\n\nCTS Clear To Send\n\nDCD Data Carrier Detect\n\nDTR Data Terminal Ready\n\nDSR Data Set Ready\n\n5  4  3  2  1\n\n9  8  7  6\n\n\n\n10.12\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nCommunications\nPort Connector and Communications Cables\n\nIRIG-B Demodulated IRIG-B time code can be input into the IRIG-B BNC connector \nat the rear of the relay (see Figure 2.2 through Figure 2.6).

Ping is an application based on ICMP over an IP \nnetwork.

Some operation modes \nof SNTP allow the relay to synchronize to one of multiple NTP servers.\n\na When properly configured (enable settings, IP addresses, etc.)\n\nTable 10.8 Protocol Session Limits (Sheet 2 of 2)\n\nProtocol Sessions Supporteda\n\n\n\n10.17\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nCommunications\nCommunications Protocols\n\nA command transmitted to the relay should consist of the command followed \nby either a CR (carriage return) or a CRLF (carriage return and line feed). You \nmay truncate commands to the first three characters. For example, EVENT 1 \n<Enter> would become EVE 1 <Enter>. Upper- and lowercase characters \nmay be used without distinction, except in passwords.\n\nSoftware Flow Control\nThe SEL-311C implements XON/XOFF flow control. You can use the \nXON/XOFF protocol to control the relay during data transmission. When the \nrelay receives XOFF during transmission, it pauses until it receives an XON \ncharacter. If there is no message in progress when the relay receives XOFF, it \nblocks transmission of any message presented to its buffer. Messages will be \naccepted after the relay receives XON.\n\nThe relay transmits XON (ASCII hex 11) and asserts the RTS output (if \nhardware handshaking is enabled) when the relay input buffer drops below \n25 percent full.\n\nThe relay transmits XOFF (ASCII hex 13) when the buffer is more than \n75 percent full. Automatic transmission sources should monitor for the XOFF \ncharacter to avoid overwriting the buffer. Transmission should terminate at the \nend of the message in progress when XOFF is received and can resume when \nthe relay sends XON.\n\nThe CAN character (ASCII hex 18) aborts a pending transmission. This is \nuseful for terminating an unwanted transmission.\n\nControl characters can be sent from most keyboards with the following \nkeystrokes.\n\n➤ XOFF: <Ctrl+S> (hold down the <Ctrl> key and press S)\n➤ XON: <Ctrl+Q> (hold down the <Ctrl> key and press Q)\n➤ CAN: <Ctrl+X> (hold down the <Ctrl> key and press X)\n\nIf hardware handshaking is enabled, the relay deasserts the RTS output when \nthe buffer is approximately 95 percent full. \n\nSerial Port and Telnet Session Automatic Messages\nWhen the Telnet or serial port AUTO setting is Y, the relay sends automatic \nmessages to indicate specific conditions. The automatic messages are \ndescribed in Table 10.9. The optional USB port does not support automatic \nmessages.\n\nWhen a serial port AUTO setting is DTA, the SEL-311C is compatible with \nthe SEL-DTA2 on that port.\n\nNOTE: The <Enter> key on most \nkeyboards is configured to send the \nASCII character 13 (^M) for a carriage \nreturn. This manual instructs you to \npress the <Enter> key after commands, \nwhich should send the proper ASCII \ncode to the relay.\n\nTable 10.9 Serial Port Automatic Messages \n\nCondition Description\n\nPower Up The relay sends a message containing the present date and time, Relay and Terminal Identifiers, and \nthe Access Level 0 prompt when the relay is turned on.\n\nEvent Trigger The relay sends an event summary each time an event report is triggered. See Section 12: Standard \nEvent Reports and SER.\n\nGroup Switch The relay displays the active settings group after a group switch occurs. See GRO Command (Display \nActive Setting Group Number) on page 10.47.\n\nSelf-Test Warning or Failure The relay sends a status report each time a self-test warning or failure condition is detected. See STA \nCommand (Relay Self-Test Status) on page 10.70.\n\n\n\n10.18\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nCommunications\nCommunications Protocols\n\nPort Access Levels\nCommands can be issued to the relay via the serial port, USB port, or Telnet \nsession to view metering values, change relay settings, etc. The available \nserial port commands are listed in Table 10.19. The commands can be \naccessed only from the corresponding access level as shown in Table 10.19. \nThe access levels are listed below.\n\n➤ Access Level 0 (the lowest access level)\n➤ Access Level 1\n\n➤ Access Level B\n\n➤ Access Level 2 (the highest access level)\n➤ Access Level C (restricted access level, should be used under \n\ndirection of SEL only)\n\nLimit Maximum Access Level or Disable Any Rear Port\nLimit the maximum allowable access level on any enabled port configured for \nTelnet, SEL ASCII, or LMD protocols using the MAXACC setting. For \nexample, if MAXACC = 1 on port 5, then the maximum access level \nattainable from a Telnet session on Port 5, 5A, and 5B is limited to Level 1. \nThe MAXACC setting on Port 5 does not limit FTP. FTP is always able to \nread and write settings files even if MAXACC = 1.\n\nFor serial port sessions and Ethernet port Telnet sessions, changing a port \nMAXACC setting to a lower access level will cause the relay to terminate any \nactive session(s) on that port that exceed the new MAXACC level. Any new access \nlevel attempts on the port are only granted as high as the MAXACC allowed level.\n\nFor the optional USB port, changing the Port F MAXACC setting to a lower \naccess level does not terminate a USB session in progress. After a QUIT \ncommand or timeout, any new access level attempts on the USB port are only \ngranted as high as the Port F MAXACC allowed level.\n\nWhen MAXACC = 0, the port is available for SEL Fast Messaging, Fast \nOperate, and Fast Synchrophasors only.\n\nDisable any port using the EPORT setting. For example, if EPORT = N on \nPort 5, then Port 5, 5A, and 5B will be nonresponsive.\n\nSee Port Enable Settings on page 9.20 for more information about these and \nother port settings.\n\nAccess Level 0\nOnce ASCII communications are established with the relay, the relay sends \nthe following prompt.\n\n=\n\nThis is referred to as Access Level 0. Enter the ACC command at the Access \nLevel 0 prompt.\n\n=ACC <Enter>\n\nThe ACC command takes the relay to Access Level 1 (see ACC, BAC, 2AC, \nand CAL Commands (Go to Access Level 1, B, 2, or C) on page 10.34 for \nmore detail).\n\n\n\n10.19\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nCommunications\nCommunications Protocols\n\nAccess Level 1\nWhen the relay is in Access Level 1, the relay sends the following prompt.\n\n=>\n\nCommands available from Access Level 1 are shown in Table 10.19. For \nexample, enter the MET command at the Access Level 1 prompt to view \nmetering data.\n\n=>MET <Enter>\n\nThe 2AC command allows the relay to go to Access Level 2 (see ACC, BAC, \n2AC, and CAL Commands (Go to Access Level 1, B, 2, or C) for more detail). \nEnter the 2AC command at the Access Level 1 prompt.\n\n=>2AC <Enter>\n\nThe BAC command allows the relay to go to Access Level B (see ACC, BAC, \n2AC, and CAL Commands (Go to Access Level 1, B, 2, or C) for more detail). \nEnter the BAC command at the Access Level 1 prompt.\n\n=>BAC <Enter>\n\nAccess Level B\nWhen the relay is in Access Level B, the relay sends the prompt.\n\n==>\n\nCommands available from Access Level B are shown in Table 10.19. For \nexample, enter the CLO command at the Access Level B prompt to close the \ncircuit breaker.\n\n==>CLO <Enter>\n\nWhile in Access Level B, any of the Access Level 1 commands are also available.\n\nThe 2AC command allows the relay to go to Access Level 2 (see ACC, BAC, \n2AC, and CAL Commands (Go to Access Level 1, B, 2, or C) for more detail). \nEnter the 2AC command at the Access Level B prompt.\n\n==>2AC <Enter>\n\nAccess Level 2\nWhen the relay is in Access Level 2, the relay sends the prompt.\n\n=>>\n\n\n\n10.20\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nCommunications\nCommunications Protocols\n\nCommands available from Access Level 2 are shown in Table 10.19. For \nexample, enter the SET command at the Access Level 2 prompt to make relay \nsettings.\n\n=>>SET <Enter>\n\nWhile in Access Level 2, any of the Access Level 1 and Access Level B \ncommands are also available.\n\nAccess Level C\nThe CAL access level is intended for use by the SEL factory, and for use by \nSEL field service personnel to help diagnose troublesome installations. A list \nof commands available at the CAL level is available from SEL upon request. \nDo not enter the CAL access level except as directed by SEL.\n\nThe CAL command allows the relay to go to Access Level C (see ACC, BAC, \n2AC, and CAL Commands (Go to Access Level 1, B, 2, or C) on page 10.34 \nfor more detail). Enter the CAL command at the Access Level 2 prompt.\n\n=>>CAL <Enter>\n\nCompressed ASCII \nProtocol\n\nSEL Compressed ASCII protocol provides compressed versions of some of \nthe relay ASCII commands. The protocol is described in Appendix K: \nCompressed ASCII Commands.\n\nSEL Fast Message \nSynchrophasor \nProtocol\n\nSEL Fast Message Synchrophasor protocol has a maximum message rate of \none per second, and is provided for compatibility with legacy installations. \nThe protocol is described in Appendix N: Synchrophasors.\n\nSEL Fast Meter \nProtocol\n\nSEL Fast Meter protocol supports binary messages to transfer metering and \ncontrol messages. The protocol is described in Appendix J: Configuration, \nFast Meter, and Fast Operate Commands.\n\nSEL Fast Sequential \nEvents Recorder \n(SER) Protocol\n\nSEL Fast Sequential Events Recorder (SER) Protocol, also known as SEL \nUnsolicited Sequential Events Recorder, provides SER events to an automated \ndata collection system. SEL Fast SER Protocol is available on any serial or \nEthernet port. The protocol is described in Appendix M: Fast SER Protocol.\n\nMIRRORED BITS \nCommunications\n\nThe SEL-311C supports MIRRORED BITS relay-to-relay communications on \ntwo ports simultaneously (see Appendix H: MIRRORED BITS Communications).\n\nSEL Distributed Port \nSwitch Protocol \n(LMD)\n\nThe SEL Distributed Port Switch Protocol (LMD) permits multiple SEL \nrelays to share a common communications channel. The protocol is selected \nby setting the port setting PROTO = LMD. See Appendix I: SEL Distributed \nPort Switch Protocol for more information.\n\nSimple Network Time \nProtocol (SNTP)\n\nWhen Port 5 setting ESNTP is not OFF, the relay internal clock conditionally \nsynchronizes to the time of day served by a Network Time Protocol (NTP) \nserver. The relay uses a simplified version of NTP called the Simple Network \nTime Protocol (SNTP). SNTP is not as accurate as IRIG-B (see Configuring \n\n\n\n10.21\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nCommunications\nCommunications Protocols\n\nHigh-Accuracy Timekeeping on page N.27). The relay can use SNTP as a less \naccurate primary time source, or as a backup to the higher accuracy IRIG-B \ntime source.\n\nSNTP as Primary or Backup Time Source\nIf an IRIG-B time source is connected and either Relay Word bits TSOK or \nTIRIG assert, then the relay synchronizes the internal time-of-day clock to the \nincoming IRIG-B time code signal, even if SNTP is configured in the relay \nand an NTP server is available. If the IRIG-B source is disconnected (if both \nTSOK and TIRIG deassert) then the relay synchronizes the internal \ntime-of-day clock to the NTP server if available. In this way an NTP server \nacts as either the primary time source, or as a backup time source to the more \naccurate IRIG-B time source.\n\nCreating an NTP Server\nThree SEL application notes available from the SEL web site describe how to \ncreate an NTP server. \n\n➤ AN2009-10: Using an SEL-2401, SEL-2404, or SEL-2407 to \nServe NTP Via the SEL-3530 RTAC\n\n➤ AN2009-32: Using SEL Satellite-Synchronized Clocks With the \nSEL-3332 or SEL-3351 to Output NTP\n\n➤ Using an SEL-2401, SEL-2404, or SEL-2407 to Create a \nStratum 1 Linux NTP Server\n\nConfiguring SNTP Client in the Relay\nTo enable SNTP in the relay make Port 5 setting ESNTP = UNICAST, \nMANYCAST, or BROADCAST. Table 10.10 shows each setting associated \nwith SNTP.\n\nSNTP Operation Modes\nThe following sections explain the settings associated with each SNTP \noperation mode (UNICAST, MANYCAST, and BROADCAST).\n\nTable 10.10 Settings Associated With SNTP \n\nSetting Range Description\n\nESNTP UNICAST, \nMANYCAST, \nBROADCAST\n\nSelects the mode of operation of SNTP. \nSee descriptions in SNTP Operation Modes.\n\nSNTPPSIP Valid IP Address Selects primary NTP server when ENSTP = \nUNICAST, or broadcast address when ESNTP = \nMANYCAST or BROADCAST.\n\nSNTPPSIB Valid IP Address Selects backup NTP server when ESNTP = UNICAST.\n\nSNTPPORT 1–65534 Ethernet port used by SNTP. Leave at default value \nunless otherwise required.\n\nSNTPRATE 15–3600 seconds Determines the rate at which the relay asks for updated \ntime from the NTP server when ESNTP = UNICAST or \nMANYCAST. Determines the time the relay will wait \nfor an NTP broadcast when ENSTP = BROADCAST.\n\nSNTPTO 5–20 seconds Determines the time the relay will wait for the NTP \nmaster to respond when ENSTP = UNICAST or \nMANYCAST.\n\n\n\n10.22\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nCommunications\nCommunications Protocols\n\nESNTP = UNICAST\nIn the unicast mode of operation the SNTP client in the relay requests time \nupdates from the primary (IP address setting SNTPPSIP) or backup (IP \naddress setting SNTPBSIP) NTP server at a rate defined by setting \nSNTPRATE. If the NTP server does not respond within the period defined by \nsetting SNTPTO then the relay tries the other SNTP server. When the relay \nsuccessfully synchronizes to the primary NTP time server, Relay Word bit \nTSNTPP asserts. When the relay successfully synchronizes to the backup \nNTP time server, Relay Word bit TSNTPB asserts.\n\nESNTP = MANYCAST\nIn manycast mode of operation the relay initially sends an NTP request to the \nbroadcast address contained in setting SNTPPSIP. The relay continues to \nbroadcast requests at a rate defined by setting SNTPRATE. When a server \nreplies, the relay considers that server to be the primary NTP server, and \nswitches to UNICAST mode, asserts Relay Word bit TSNTPP, and thereafter \nrequests updates from the primary server. If the NTP server stops responding \nfor time SNTPTO, the relay deasserts TSNTPP and begins to broadcast \nrequests again until that or another server responds.\n\nESNTP = BROADCAST\nIf setting SNTPPSIP = 0.0.0.0 while setting ESNTP = BROADCAST, the \nrelay will listen for and synchronize to any broadcasting NTP server. If setting \nSNTPPSIP is set to a specific IP address while setting ESNTP = \nBROADCAST, then the relay will listen for and synchronize to only NTP \nserver broadcasts from that address. When synchronized the relay asserts \nRelay Word bit TSNTPP. Relay Word bit TSNTPP deasserts if the relay does \nnot receive a valid broadcast within five seconds after the period defined by \nsetting SNTPRATE.\n\nSNTP Accuracy Considerations\nSNTP time synchronization accuracy is limited by the accuracy of the NTP \nServer and by the networking environment. The highest degree of SNTP time \nsynchronization can be achieved by minimizing the number of switches and \nrouters between the NTP Server and the SEL-311C. Network monitoring \nsoftware can also be used to ensure average and worst-case network \nbandwidth utilization is moderate. \n\nWhen installed on a network configured with one Ethernet switch between the \nSEL-311C and the NTP Server, and when using ESNTP = UNICAST or \nMANYCAST, the relay time synchronization error with the NTP server is \ntypically less than ±1 millisecond.\n\nUsing the Embedded \nWeb Server (HTTP)\n\nWhen Port 5 setting EHTTP := Y, the relay serves web pages displaying \ncertain settings, metering, and status reports. The relay embedded web server \nhas been optimized and tested to work with the most popular web browsers, \nbut should work with any standard web browser. As many as three users can \naccess the embedded web server simultaneously. \n\nAccess Level 1 provides a read-only display of settings, reports, and meter \nvalues. Access Level 2 allows the user to upgrade firmware over the Web \nServer interface (see Method Three: Using a Web Browser on page B.21). \nPort 5 setting HTTPACC determines the maximum access level available to \nthe web server, and its default is level 2. \n\n\n\n10.23\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nCommunications\nCommunications Protocols\n\nTo begin using the embedded web server, launch your web browser, and \nbrowse to http://IPADDR, where IPADDR is the Port 5 setting IPADDR (e.g., \nhttp://192.168.1.2). The relay responds with a login screen as shown in \nFigure 10.4.\n\nFigure 10.4 Web Server Login Screen\n\nIf HTTPACC is set to 2, Access Level 1 (ACC) or Access Level 2 (2AC) can \nbe chosen from the Access Level drop down box. Enter the appropriate \npassword(s) in the text box(es) below the Access Level drop down box. If \n2AC is chosen, both the ACC and 2AC passwords must be entered to login, as \nshown in Figure 10.4. Note that access level passwords are not encrypted in \nany way by the web server when logging in. \n\nOnce you have entered the correct password(s), the relay responds with the \nmeter display home page. While you remain logged into the relay, the web \npage displays the approximate time as determined by the relay time-of-day \nclock, and increments the displayed time every few seconds based on the \nclock contained in your PC. Figure 10.5 shows an example of the Device \nFeatures screen, equivalent to the relay version (VER) command.\n\nFigure 10.5 Web Server Response to System, Device Features Selection\n\n\n\n10.24\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nCommunications\nCommunications Protocols\n\nClick on any menu selection from the left pane to retrieve various reports. \nSome menus expand to reveal more menus, such as the Show Settings menu \nshown in Figure 10.6.\n\nFigure 10.6 Web Server Show Settings Screen\n\nThe Meter Reports screens update automatically about every five seconds.\n\nTo log out, either close the web browser window or click on [Logout] in the \nbanner bar near the top of the web page.\n\nFile Transfer Protocol \n(FTP) and MMS File \nTransfer\n\nFile Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard protocol for exchanging files \nbetween computers over a TCP/IP network. The SEL-311C operates as an \nFTP server, presenting files to FTP clients. The relay supports one FTP \nsession at a time. Requests to establish additional FTP sessions are denied.\n\nManufacturing Messaging Specification (MMS) is used in IEC 61850 \napplications and provides services for the transfer of real-time data, including \nfiles, within a substation LAN.\n\nFile Structure\nThe file structure is organized as a directory and subdirectory tree similar to \nthat used by Windows and other common operating systems. See Virtual File \nInterface on page 10.25 for information on available files.\nFile dates within the last 12 months are displayed with month, day, hour, and \nminutes. Dates older than 12 months have the year, month, and day. The times \nare UTC.\n\nAccess Control\nTo log on to the FTP server, enter the value of the Port 5 setting FTPUSER as \nthe user name in your FTP application. Enter the Level 2 password as the \npassword in your FTP application. Note that FTP does not encrypt passwords \nbefore sending them to the server.\n\n\n\n10.25\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nCommunications\nVirtual File Interface\n\nMMS is enabled when Port 5 setting E61850 is set to Y. MMS File Transfer is \nenabled when setting EMMSFS is set to Y. If MMS Authentication is enabled \nvia the CID file, then an authenticated connection must be established via \nMMS for MMS file transfer to take place.\n\nUsing FTP and MMS\nA free FTP application is included with most web browser software and PC \noperating systems. You can also obtain free or inexpensive FTP applications \nfrom the Internet. Once you have retrieved the necessary files, be sure to close \nthe FTP connection by using the disconnect function of your FTP application \nor by completely closing the application. Failure to do so can cause the FTP \nconnection to remain open, which blocks subsequent connection attempts \nuntil FTPIDLE time expires.\n\nSee Appendix P: IEC 61850 for information about using MMS.\n\nVirtual File Interface\nYou can retrieve and send data as files through the relay virtual file interface. \nDevices with embedded computers can also use the virtual file interface. \nWhen using serial ports or virtual terminal links, use the FILE DIR command \nto access the file interface.\n\nSend and receive files using the following three protocols:\n\n1. File Transfer Protocol (FTP)\n2. MMS File Transfer\n\n3. Ymodem\n\nFTP and MMS File \nStructure\n\nFTP and MMS have a two-level file structure. Files are available at the root \nlevel and subdirectories. Table 10.11 shows the directories and their contents.\nt\n\nRoot Directory\nThe root directory contains files and subdirectories as shown in Table 10.11.\n\nCFG.TXT File (Read-Only)\nThe CFG.TXT file contains general configuration information about the relay \nand each settings class. External support software retrieves the CFG.TXT file \nto interact automatically with the relay. The relay calculates a checksum, or \n\nTable 10.11 Virtual File Structure \n\nDirectory Contents\nAccess \nLevel\n\nRoot CFG.TXT file, CFG.XML file, ERR.TXT file and \nSET_61850.CID and the SETTINGS, REPORTS, \nDIAGNOSTICS, EVENTS, and COMTRADEa directories \n\na The COMTRADE directory is only available in MMS file structure.\n\n1\n\nSETTINGS Relay settings 1\n\nREPORTS SER, target, metering, circuit breaker, and history reports 1\n\nDIAGNOSTICS Relay status and vector reports 1\n\nEVENTS CEV, COMTRADE, and history reports 1\n\nCOMTRADEa COMTRADE events 1\n\n\n\n10.26\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nCommunications\nVirtual File Interface\n\nhash code, for each settings class and lists the codes in the CFG.TXT file (see \nFigure 10.7). Improve system security by periodically reading the CFG.TXT \nfile and comparing the current hash codes to those in a secured copy of the \nfile. See Appendix Q: Cybersecurity Features for more information.\n\nFigure 10.7 CFG.TXT File\n\nCFG.XML File (Read-Only)\nPresent only in units with the optional Ethernet card installed, the CFG.XML \nfile is supplementary to the CFG.TXT file. The CFG.XML file describes the \nIED configuration, any options such as the Ethernet port, and includes \nfirmware identification, settings class names, and configuration file \ninformation.\n\nERR.TXT (Read-Only) and SET_61850.CID File\nPresent if ordered with the IEC 61850 protocol option. The ERR.TXT file \ncontents is based on the most recent SET_61850.CID file written to the relay. \nIf there were no errors, the file is empty. If errors occurred, the relay logs these \nerrors in the ERR.TXT file. The SET_61850.CID file contains the IEC 61850 \nconfigured IED description in XML. ACSELERATOR Architect® SEL-5032 \nSoftware generates and then downloads this file to the relay. See Appendix L: \nIEC 61850 for more information.\n\nSettings Directory\nYou can access the relay settings through files in the SETTINGS directory. We \nrecommend that you use support software to access the settings files, rather \nthan directly accessing them via other means. External settings support \nsoftware reads settings from all of these files to perform its functions. The \nrelay only allows you to write to the individual SET_cn files, where c is the \nsettings class code and n is the settings instance. Except for the SET_61850 \nCID file, changing settings with external support software involves the \nfollowing steps:\n\nStep 1. The PC software reads the CFG.TXT and SET_ALL.TXT files \nfrom the relay.\n\n[INFO]\nRELAYTYPE=0311C\nFID=SEL-311C-3-R507-V0-Z103101-Dyyyymmdd\nBFID=SLBT-3CF1-R200-V0-Z100100-D20120321\nPARTNO=0311C30HH3J54X1\n[CLASSES]\n\"1\",\"Group 1\",\"SET_1.TXT\",\"88FE63CB\"\n\"2\",\"Group 2\",\"SET_2.TXT\",\"88FE63CB\"\n\"3\",\"Group 3\",\"SET_3.TXT\",\"88FE63CB\"\n\"4\",\"Group 4\",\"SET_4.TXT\",\"88FE63CB\"\n\"5\",\"Group 5\",\"SET_5.TXT\",\"88FE63CB\"\n\"6\",\"Group 6\",\"SET_6.TXT\",\"88FE63CB\"\n\"D1\",\"DNP Map 1\",\"SET_D1.TXT\",\"761C0BCD\"\n\"D2\",\"DNP Map 2\",\"SET_D2.TXT\",\"761C0BCD\"\n\"D3\",\"DNP Map 3\",\"SET_D3.TXT\",\"761C0BCD\"\n\"G\",\"Global\",\"SET_G.TXT\",\"99901E1D\"\n\"L1\",\"Logic 1\",\"SET_L1.TXT\",\"C0E7C556\"\n\"L2\",\"Logic 2\",\"SET_L2.TXT\",\"C0E7C556\"\n\"L3\",\"Logic 3\",\"SET_L3.TXT\",\"C0E7C556\"\n\"L4\",\"Logic 4\",\"SET_L4.TXT\",\"C0E7C556\"\n\"L5\",\"Logic 5\",\"SET_L5.TXT\",\"C0E7C556\"\n\"L6\",\"Logic 6\",\"SET_L6.TXT\",\"C0E7C556\"\n\"M\",\"Modbus\",\"SET_M.TXT\",\"FCC01D5C\"\n\"P1\",\"Port 1\",\"SET_P1.TXT\",\"939DC3DD\"\n\"P2\",\"Port 2\",\"SET_P2.TXT\",\"55D70365\"\n\"P3\",\"Port 3\",\"SET_P3.TXT\",\"C47944EC\"\n\"PF\",\"Port F\",\"SET_PF.TXT\",\"8A4F4858\"\n\"P5\",\"Port 5\",\"SET_P5.TXT\",\"FBA33731\"\n\"R\",\"Report\",\"SET_R.TXT\",\"165EA02E\"\n\"T\",\"Text\",\"SET_T.TXT\",\"ABACF931\"\n[STORAGE]\n\n\n\n10.27\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nCommunications\nVirtual File Interface\n\nStep 2.

Different commands are available at the different access levels \nas shown in Table 10.19. Commands ACC, BAC, 2AC, and CAL are \nexplained together because they operate similarly.\n\nPassword Requirements\nPasswords are required if the main board Access jumper is not in place \n(Access jumper = OFF). Passwords are not required if the main board Access \njumper is in place (Access jumper = ON). Refer to Figure 2.20 for Access \njumper information. See PAS Command (Change Passwords) on page 10.57 \nfor the list of default passwords and for more information on changing \npasswords.\n\nAccess Level Attempt (Password Required)\nAssume the following conditions: Access jumper = OFF (not in place), Access \nLevel = 0.\n\nAt the Access Level 0 prompt, enter the ACC command.\n\n=ACC <Enter>\n\nBecause the Access jumper is not in place, the relay asks for the Access \nLevel 1 password to be entered.\n\nPassword: ?\n\nSEL-311: This is the RID setting (the relay is shipped with the \ndefault setting RID = SEL-311; see Identifier Labels \non page 9.16).\n\nSTATION A: This is the TID setting (the relay is shipped with the \ndefault setting TID = STATION A; see Identifier \nLabels on page 9.16).\n\nDate: This is the date the command response was given \n(except for relay response to the EVE command \n[Event], where it is the date the event occurred). You \ncan modify the date display format (Month/Day/Year \nor Year/Month/Day) by changing the DATE_F relay \nsetting.\n\nTime: This is the time the command response was given \n(except for relay response to the EVE command, \nwhere it is the time the event occurred).\n\nCommand Description\n\nACC Moves from Access Level 0 to Access Level 1\n\nBAC Moves from Access Level 1 to Access Level B\n\n2AC Moves from Access Level 1 or B to Access Level 2\n\nCAL Moves from Access Level 2 to Access Level C\n\n\n\n10.35\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nCommunications\nCommand Explanations\n\nThe relay is shipped with the default Access Level 1 password shown in the table \nunder PAS Command (Change Passwords) on page 10.57. At the prompt above, \nenter the default password and press the <Enter> key. The relay responds as \nfollows.\n\nSEL-311                          Date: 10/15/10    Time: 08:31:10.361\nSTATION A\n\nLevel 1\n=>\n\nThe => prompt indicates the relay is now in Access Level 1.\n\nIf the entered password is incorrect, the relay asks for the password again \n(Password: ?). If the requested password is incorrectly entered for levels \nabove Access Level 1, the relay asserts Relay Word bit PASNVAL for \napproximately one second. After three attempts, the relay displays an invalid \naccess message, asserts Relay Word bit BADPASS for approximately \n1 second and prevents further access attempts for 30 seconds.\n\nAccess Level Attempt (Password Not Required)\nAssume the following conditions: Access jumper = ON (in place), Access \nLevel = 0.\n\nAt the Access Level 0 prompt, enter the ACC command.\n\n=ACC <Enter>\n\nBecause the Access jumper is in place, the relay does not ask for a password; \nit goes directly to Access Level 1. The relay responds as follows.\n\nSEL-311                          Date: 10/15/10    Time: 08:31:10.361\nSTATION A\n\nLevel 1\n=>\n\nThe => prompt indicates the relay is now in Access Level 1.\n\nAccess Level Indication\nThe relay asserts Relay Word bit ACCESSP for approximately one second \nafter a successful Level B, Level 2, or Level C access. Relay Word bit \nACCESS also asserts and remains asserted when an access level above Access \nLevel 1 has been achieved on any port or on the front panel. These Relay \nWord bits can be used to create custom alarm schemes. See Output Contacts \non page 7.33.

If \nthe bit numbers do not match, the relay responds as follows.\n\nInvalid Command\n\nSee Remote Control Switches on page 7.10 for more information.\n\nCOP Command \n(Copy Setting Group \nor DNP Map)\n\nCopy relay and SELOGIC control equation settings from setting Group m to \nsetting Group n with the COP m n command. Copy DNP Map settings from \nMap m to Map n with the COP D m n command. Setting group numbers \nrange from 1 to 6 and DNP maps range from 1 to 3. After entering settings \ninto one setting group or map with the SET command, copy them to the other \ngroup(s) or map with the COP command. Use the SET command to modify \nthe copied settings. The relay disables for a few seconds and Relay Word bit \nSETCHG pulses for approximately one second.\n\nFor example, to copy settings from Group 1 to Group 3 issue the following \ncommand.\n\n=>>COP 1 3 <Enter>\n\nCopy 1 to 3\nAre you sure (Y/N) ? Y <Enter>\n\nPlease wait...\nSettings copied\n=>>\n\nDAT Command \n(View/Change Date)\n\nDAT displays the date stored by the internal calendar/clock. If the Global setting \nDATE_F is set to MDY, the date is displayed as month/day/year. If the date format \nsetting DATE_F is set to YMD, the date is displayed as year/month/day.\n\nTable 10.20 SEL-311C Control Subcommand\n\nSubcommand Description\n\nSRB n Set Remote Bit n (“ON” position)\nCRB n Clear Remote Bit n (“OFF” position)\nPRB n Pulse Remote Bit n for 1/4 cycle (“MOMENTARY” position)\n\nCommand Description Access Level\n\nCOPY m n Copy relay and logic settings from group m to group n. 2\n\nCOPY D m n Copy DNP Map m into Map n. 2\n\nParameter Description\n\nm Parameter m is a group number from 1 to 6 or a map number from 1 to 3.\n\nn Parameter n is a group number from 1 to 6 or a map number from 1 to 3.\n\nCommand Description Access Level\n\nDATE Display the internal clock date. 1\n\nDATE date Set the internal clock date (DATE_F set to MDY or YMD). 1\n\n\n\n10.42\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nCommunications\nCommand Explanations\n\nTo set the date follow the steps below.\n\nStep 1.

If the DATE_F is set to YMD, enter DATE yy/mm/dd <Enter>.\n\nTo set the date to October 15, 2010, enter the following.\n\n=>DATE 10/15/10 <Enter>\n\n10/15/10\n=>\n\nYou can separate the month, day, and year parameters with spaces, commas, \nslashes, colons, and semicolons. The year can be entered with four digits \n(e.g., 2010), and the SEL-311C displays it in a two-digit format (e.g., 10).\nIf an IRIG-B or SNTP time synchronization signal is connected to the relay, \nthe DAT command cannot alter the month or day portion of the date. If the \nIRIG-B or SNTP time source is IEEE C37.118 compliant and Global setting \nIRIGC = C37.118, or if an SNTP time source is connected, the DAT command \ncannot alter the year.

For more information on MIRRORED BITS, \nsee Appendix H: MIRRORED BITS Communications.\n\nWith the transmitter of the communications channel physically looped back to \nthe receiver, the MIRRORED BITS addressing will be wrong and ROK will \ndeassert. The LOO command tells the MIRRORED BITS software to \ntemporarily expect to see its own data looped back as its input. In this mode, \nRelay Word bit LBOK will assert if error-free data are received. The LOO \ncommand with just the channel specifier enables looped back mode on that \nchannel for five minutes, while the inputs are forced to the default values.\n\nMAC Command The MAC command returns the Media Access Control (MAC) address of the \nEthernet port.

Metered \nquantities include phase voltages and currents, sequence component voltages \nand currents, power, frequency, substation battery voltage, energy, demand, \nand maximum/minimum logging of selected quantities. To make the extensive \namount of meter information manageable, the relay divides the displayed \ninformation into five reports: Instantaneous, Demand, Energy, \nMaximum/Minimum, and Synchrophasors.\n\nSee Section 8: Metering and Monitoring for more information on metering.\n\nMET k—Instantaneous Metering\nUse the MET k command to display fundamental metering data.\n\nThe MET k command displays instantaneous magnitudes (and angles if \napplicable) of the following quantities.\n\nThe angles are referenced to voltage VA if VA is greater than 13 V secondary; \notherwise, the angles are referenced to A-phase current. The angles range \nfrom –179.99 to 180.00 degrees.\n\nTo view instantaneous metering values, enter the MET k command\n\n=>MET k <Enter>\n\nwhere k is an optional parameter to specify the number of times (1–32767) to \nrepeat the meter display. If k is not specified, the meter report is displayed \nonce. \n\nNOTE: If the serial port AUTO setting \nis DTA, the SEL-311C response for MET, \nMET X, and MET D will be formatted \ndifferently on that serial port than \nshown below.

Relay Word bit OC can then be programmed into the BKMTR \nSELOGIC control equation to assert the TRIP Relay Word bit, which in turn \nasserts an output contact (e.g., OUT101 = TRIP) to trip a circuit breaker.\n\nThe OC Relay Word bit appears in the factory-default SELogic control equation \nsettings for TR and 79DTL. See Trip Logic on page 5.1 and Drive-to-Lockout and \nDrive-to-Last Shot Settings (79DTL and 79DLS, Respectively) on page 6.25.\nTo issue the OPE command, enter the following.\n\n==>OPE <Enter>\n\nOpen Breaker  (Y/N) ? Y <Enter>\nAre you sure (Y/N) ? Y <Enter>\n==>\n\nTyping N <Enter> after either of the above prompts will abort the command.\n\nThe OPE command is supervised by the main board Breaker jumper (see \nFigure 2.20). If the Breaker jumper is not in place (Breaker jumper = OFF), \nthe relay does not execute the OPE command and responds:\n\nAborted: No Breaker Jumper\n\nPAS Command \n(Change Passwords)\n\nThe relay is shipped with factory-default passwords for Access Levels 1, B, 2, \nand C. These passwords are shown in Table 10.21.\n\nThe PASsword command allows you to change existing Level 1, B, and 2 \npasswords at Access Level 2 and allows you to change the Level C password \nfrom Level C. To change passwords, enter PAS x, where x is the access level \nwhose password is being changed. The relay will prompt for the old password, \nnew password, and a confirmation of the new password.\n\nTo change the password for Access Level 1, enter the following.\n\n=>>PAS 1 <Enter>\n\nOld Password: *********\n\nNew Password: ******\nConfirm New Password: ******\n\nPassword Changed\n=>>\n\nCommand Description Access Level\n\nOPE Assert the open command Relay Word bit OC.

Default passwords should \nbe changed to private passwords at \ninstallation. Failure to change each \ndefault password to a private \npassword may allow unauthorized \naccess. SEL shall not be responsible \nfor any damage resulting from \nunauthorized access.\n\n! WARNING\n\n\n\n10.58\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nCommunications\nCommand Explanations\n\nThe new password will not echo on the screen, and passwords cannot be \nviewed from the device. Record the new password in a safe place for future \nreference.\n\nIf the passwords are lost or you wish to operate the relay without password \nprotection, put the main board Access jumper in place (Access jumper = ON). \nRefer to Figure 2.20 for Access jumper information. With the Access jumper \nin place, issue the PAS x command at Access Level 2. The relay will prompt \nfor a new password and a confirmation of the new password.\n\nPasswords may include as many as 12 characters. See Table 10.22 for valid \ncharacters. Upper- and lowercase letters are treated as different characters. \nStrong passwords consist of 12 characters, with at least one special character \nor digit and mixed-case sensitivity, but do not form a name, date, acronym, or \nword. Passwords formed in this manner are less susceptible to password \nguessing and automated attacks. Examples of valid, distinct strong passwords \nare shown below.\n\n➤ Ot3579A24.68\n\n➤ Ih2d&s4u-Iwg\n\n➤ .311c.Nt9g-t\n\nThe relay issues a weak password warning if the new password does not \ninclude at least one special character, number, lowercase letter, and uppercase \nletter.\n\n=>>PAS 1 <Enter>\n\nOld Password: *********\n\nNew Password: ******\nConfirm New Password: ******\n\nPassword Changed\n=>>\n\nCAUTION:  This password can be strengthened.  Strong passwords do not include a name, \ndate, acronym, or word.  They consist of the maximum allowable characters, with \nat least one special character, number, lower-case letter, and upper-case \nletter.  A change in password is recommended.\n\n=>>\n\nPING Command The PING command allows you to determine if a host is reachable across an \nIP network and/or if the Ethernet port is functioning or configured correctly. \nWhen you are setting up or testing substation networks, it is helpful to \ndetermine if the network is connected properly and if the other devices are \npowered up and configured properly.\n\nTable 10.22 Valid Password Characters\n\nAlpha ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nNumeric 0123456789\n\nSpecial ! \" # $ % & ' ( ) * , - . / : ; < = > ? @ [ \\ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~\n\nCommand Description\nAccess \nLevel\n\nPING addr Use PING addr without parameters to ping the specified \naddress every 1 second until the command is canceled or \n30 minutes elapse.\n\n1\n\nPING addr [Ii] Ping the specified address at the specified interval until the \ncommand is canceled or 30 minutes elapse.\n\n1\n\n\n\n10.59\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nCommunications\nCommand Explanations\n\nAfter valid PING command is issued, the relay sends out an ICMP echo \nrequest message at a 1-second interval (unless overridden by the Ii parameter) \nuntil receiving a carriage return <CR>, the letter Q is typed, or the 30-minute \nduration elapses (unless overridden by the Tt parameter). Use the optional Ii \nparameter to specify the time in seconds (1–30) between successive ping \ncommands. If Ii is not specified, the interval between successive ping \ncommands is 1 second. Use the optional Tt parameter to specify the duration \nin minutes (1–60) of the PING command. If Tt is not specified, the ping \nduration is 30 minutes.\n\nCommand PING 10.201.7.52 I1 is executed in the following example.\n\n=>PING 10.201.7.52 I1 <Enter>\nPinging 10.201.7.52\nPress <Enter> or Q to Terminate Ping Test\nReply from 10.201.7.52\nReply from 10.201.7.52\nReply from 10.201.7.52\nReply from 10.201.7.52\nReply from 10.201.7.52\nReply from 10.201.7.52\nNo response from host 10.201.7.52\nPing test stopped.\n\nPing Statistics for 10.201.7.52\nPackets: Sent = 7, Received = 6, Lost = 1\nElapsed Time:    13 seconds\n\n=>\n\nFigure 10.9 PING Command Response\n\nPUL Command (Pulse \nOutput Contact)\n\nThe PUL command allows you to pulse any of the output contacts for a \nspecified length of time.

The first two rows \n(0 and 1) correspond to the relay front-panel target LEDs. The target row \nelements are asserted when the corresponding front-panel target LED is \nilluminated.\n\nThe remaining target rows (2–110) correspond to the Relay Word as described \nin Table D.1. A Relay Word bit is either at a logical 1 (asserted) or a logical 0 \n(deasserted). Relay Word bits are used in SELOGIC control equations. See \nAppendix F: Setting SELOGIC Control Equations.\n\nThe TAR command does not remap the front-panel target LEDs, as is done in \nsome previous SEL relays. But the execution of the equivalent TAR command \nvia the front-panel display does remap the bottom row of the front-panel target \nLEDs (see Figure 11.3, pushbutton OTHER).\nThe TAR command options are listed below.\n\nCommand Description Access Level\n\nTAR Use TARGET without parameters to display Relay \nWord row 0 or last displayed target row.\n\n1\n\nTAR name k Display the target row containing name.

The command \noverrides values in the communications interfaces (SEL Fast Message, DNP, \nModbus, and IEC 61850) only. The actual values used by the relay for \nprotection and control are not changed. However, remote devices may use \nthese analog and digital signals to make control decisions. Ensure that remote \ndevices are properly configured to receive the overridden data before using the \nTEST DB command.\n\nTo override analog data in a communications interface, enter the following \nfrom Access Level B or higher.\n\n=>>TEST DB A name value <Enter>\n\nwhere value is a numerical value and name is an analog label from Table E.1, \nAnalog Quantities, with an “x” in the DNP, Modbus, Fast Meter, or IEC 61850 \ncolumn.\n\nFor example, the TEST DB command can be used to force the value of \nPhase A current magnitude transmitted to a remote device to 100 amps.\n\n=>>TEST DB A IA 100 <Enter>\n\nTo override digital data in a Modbus, DNP, or IEC 61850 communications \ninterface, enter the following from Access Level B or higher.\n\n=>>TEST DB D name value <Enter>\n\nwhere name is a Relay Word bit (see Table D.1) and value is 1 or 0.\n\nCommand Description Access Level\n\nTEST DB Display the present status of digital and analog overrides.

It also describes the default \ndisplays.\n\nThis section discusses the following functions in detail:\n\n➤ Front-Panel Pushbutton Operation\n\n➤ Functions Unique to the Front-Panel Interface on page 11.5\n➤ Rotating Display on page 11.11\n\n➤ Programmable Operator Controls on page 11.14\n\nFront-Panel Pushbutton Operation\nOverview Note in Figure 11.1 that most of the pushbuttons have dual functions (primary/secondary).\n\nThe primary functions are shown above the buttons. A primary function is \nselected first (e.g., METER pushbutton).\nAfter a primary function is selected, the pushbuttons operate on their \nsecondary functions, which are shown on the face of the buttons (CANCEL, \nSELECT, left/right arrows, up/down arrows, EXIT). For example, after the METER \npushbutton is pressed, the up/down arrows are used to scroll through the \nfront-panel metering screens.

In this situation, if the front-panel SELECT key is pressed \nwhile a set local control switch is being displayed, the relay will display a \nCommand Unavailable error message on the LCD, and then return to the \ndisplay of the first set local control switch.\n\nAfter the SET session has been completed, the local control switches can be \noperated.\n\nLocal Control State Retained When Relay De-Energized\nLocal bit states are stored in nonvolatile memory, so when power to the relay \nis turned off, the local bit states are retained.\n\nFor example, suppose the local control switch with local bit output LB1 is \nconfigured as an ON/OFF type switch (see Figure 11.5). Additionally, \nsuppose it is used to enable/disable reclosing. If local bit LB1 is at logical 1, \nreclosing is enabled:\n\nIf power to the relay is turned off and then turned on again, local bit LB1 \nremains at logical 1, and reclosing is still enabled. This is akin to a traditional \npanel, where enabling/disabling of reclosing and other functions is \naccomplished by panel-mounted switches. If dc control voltage to the panel is \nlost and then restored again, the switch positions are still in place. If the \nreclosing switch is in the enable position (switch closed) before the power \noutage, it will be in the same position after the outage when power is restored.\n\nContinuing from the previous example settings, suppose the traditional reclose \nenable/disable function is provided by optoisolated input IN102 with the \nfollowing SELOGIC control equation drive-to-lockout setting:\n\n79DTL = OC + !IN102 + LB3 =OC + NOT(IN102) + LB3\nLocal bit LB3 is the output of the previously discussed local control switch \nconfigured as a manual trip switch. The relay is driven to lockout for any \nmanual trip via LB3.\n\nRelay Word bit OC asserts when the serial port OPEN command is executed. \nAssuming that an OPEN command has not been executed and LB3 has not \nasserted, when input IN102 is energized (IN102 = logical 1), reclosing is \nenabled (not driven-to-lockout):\n\n79DTL = OC + !IN102 + LB3 = logical 0 + !(logical 1) + logical 0 = logical 0\nIf local bit LB1 is substituted for input IN102 to provide the reclose enable/disable \nfunction, the SELOGIC control equation drive-to-lockout setting is set as follows:\n\n79DTL = OC + !LB1 + LB3 [=OC + NOT(LB1) + LB3]\nNotice that local bit 1 is inverted [!LB1 = NOT(LB1)] in the SELOGIC control \nequation to match the sense of the previous !IN102 term.\n\nSee Drive-to-Lockout and Drive-to-Last Shot Settings (79DTL and 79DLS, \nRespectively) on page 6.25 for more information on setting 79DTL.\n\nLogical 1 LB1\n\nENABLE\nRECLOSER\n\nDISABLE\n(Logical 0)\n\nLocal\nBit\n\n\n\n11.11\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nFront-Panel Interface\nRotating Display\n\nRotating Display\nWith factory-default settings, the channel IA, IB, IC, and IG current values (in \nA primary) display continually if no local control is operational (i.e., no local \ncontrol switches are enabled) and no display point labels are enabled for display.\n\nGlobal setting FPNGD determines whether IN (current channel IN) or IG \n(residual ground current) displays in the lower right-hand corner, or whether \nthe lower right-hand corner is blank.

Compressed ASCII event reports are in a computer \nreadable format, suitable for SEL-5601 Analytic Assistant or ACSELERATOR \nQuickSet® SEL-5030 Software.\nEvent reports are useful in commissioning tests, system disturbance analysis, \nand protective device or scheme performance analysis. \n\nEvent report data are stored to nonvolatile memory just after they are \ngenerated.\n\nEvent report information includes:\n\n➤ Unique event identification number.\n\n➤ Date and time of the event report trigger with 1 ms resolution.\n\n➤ Individual sample analog input oscillography (currents and \nvoltages) at 4, 16, 32, or 128 samples per cycle.\n\n➤ System frequency.\n\n➤ EVE: Digital element states of selected Relay Word bits (listed \nin Table 12.4) at 4 samples per cycle.\n\n➤ CEV: Digital element states of all Relay Word bits at 4 samples \nper cycle.\n\n\n\n12.2\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nStandard Event Reports and SER\nStandard 15/30/60/180-Cycle Event Reports\n\n➤ EVE: Event summary, including the front-panel target states at \nthe time of tripping, fault current, fault location, and fault type.\n\n➤ CEV: Event summary, including the front-panel target states at \nthe time of tripping, fault current, fault location, fault type, \nimpedance to the fault location in secondary ohms, line angle \nto the fault location, distance to the fault in per-unit of line \nlength, and fault resistance in secondary ohms.\n\n➤ Group, Logic, and Global settings that were active at time of \nthe event trigger.\n\n➤ 10 µs precision trigger time stamps and relative sample times \n(available when a high-accuracy IRIG-B time source is \nconnected to the relay).\n\nAn adjustable prefault recording period allows system conditions to be \ncaptured prior to the actual event report trigger.\n\nUse the SEL-5601 Analytic Assistant Software and ACSELERATOR QuickSet \nto analyze Compressed ASCII and COMTRADE file format versions of the \nevent report. With this software, you can easily do the following:\n\n➤ View or print oscillographic traces and digital element traces.\n\n➤ Perform step-by-step phasor analysis of the prefault, fault, and \npost-fault intervals.\n\n➤ View power system harmonic data.\n\nSequential Events \nRecorder (SER)\n\nThe SER report captures detailed digital element state changes over a long \ntime period. Programmable trigger lists allow as many as 72 Relay Word bits \nto be monitored, in addition to the automatically generated triggers for relay \npower-up, settings changes, and active setting group changes. State changes \nare time-tagged to the nearest millisecond.\n\nSER report data are useful in commissioning tests and during operation for \nsystem monitoring and control.\n\nSER information is stored to nonvolatile memory when state changes occur.\n\nStandard 15/30/60/180-Cycle Event Reports\nSee Figure 12.7 for an example event report.\n\nEvent Report Length \n(Settings LER and \nPRE)\n\nThe SEL-311C provides user-programmable event report length and prefault \nlength. Event report length is either 15, 30, 60, or 180 cycles. Prefault length \nranges from 1 to 179 cycles. Prefault length is the first part of the event report \nthat precedes the event report triggering point.\n\nSet the event report length with the LER setting. Set the prefault length with \nthe PRE setting. See the SET G command in Table 9.2 and corresponding \nEvent Report Parameters on page SET.1 for instructions on setting the LER \nand PRE settings.\n\nChanging the LER setting will erase all events stored in nonvolatile memory. \nChanging the PRE setting has no effect on the nonvolatile reports.\n\nNOTE: Figure 12.7 is on multiple \npages.\n\n\n\n12.3\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nStandard Event Reports and SER\nStandard 15/30/60/180-Cycle Event Reports\n\nEvent Report \nCapacity\n\nThe SEL-311C event report capacity depends on the selected event report \nlength (LER setting), as shown in Table 12.1.\n\nThe SEL-311C stores event reports in nonvolatile memory soon after the \nevents are captured. If the power supply is interrupted during the saving of an \nevent report, the relay will report Invalid Data for the event that was not \nfully stored.\n\nStandard Event \nReport Triggering\n\nThe relay triggers (generates) a standard event report when any of the \nfollowing occur:\n\n➤ Relay Word bit TRIP asserts\n\n➤ Programmable SELOGIC® control equation setting ER asserts \nto logical 1\n\n➤ TRI (Trigger Event Reports) serial port command executed\n➤ Any output contact is pulsed via Modbus® or the serial \n\nport/front-panel PUL (Pulse Output Contact) command\n\nRelay Word Bit TRIP\nRefer to Figure 5.1. If Relay Word bit TRIP asserts, an event report is \nautomatically generated. Thus, any condition that causes a trip does not have \nto be entered in SELOGIC control equation setting ER.\n\nThe factory settings for trip settings TR, TRQUAL, and BKMTR are as \nfollows:\n\nTR = M2PT + Z2GT + 51GT + 51QT\n\nTRQUAL = M1P + Z1G\n\nBKMTR = OC\n\nIf any of the individual conditions in the TR equation (M2PT, Z2GT, 51GT, or \n51QT), or the BKMTR equation (OC) assert, Relay Word bit TRIP asserts \nimmediately. If any of the elements in the TRQUAL equation (M1P or Z1GT) \nassert, the TRIP bit asserts within 2 cycles, depending on the state of the \ndisturbance detector logic. In either case an event report is automatically \ngenerated once TRIP asserts. Thus, these conditions do not have to be entered \nin SELOGIC control equation setting ER.\n\nThe SEL-311C asserts Relay Word bit TRIP for any single-pole trip or \nthree-pole trip condition. See Trip Logic on page 5.1 for full details.\n\nProgrammable SELOGIC Control Equation Setting ER\nThe programmable SELOGIC control equation event report trigger setting ER \nis set to trigger standard event reports for conditions other than trip conditions. \nWhen setting ER sees a logical 0 to logical 1 transition, it generates an event \nreport (if the SEL-311C is not already generating a report that encompasses \nthe new transition). The factory setting for the SEL-311C relay is:\n\nTable 12.1 Event Report Capacity\n\nLER Setting Number of Event Reports Stored\n\n15 cycles (factory default) 43\n30 cycles 25\n\n60 cycles 13\n\n180 cycles 4\n\n\n\n12.4\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nStandard Event Reports and SER\nStandard 15/30/60/180-Cycle Event Reports\n\nER = /M2P + /Z2G + /51G + /51Q + /50P1 + /LOP\n\nThe elements in this example setting are:\n\nNote the rising-edge operator / in front of each of these elements. See \nAppendix F: Setting SELOGIC Control Equations for more information on \nrising-edge operators and SELOGIC control equations in general.\n\nRising-edge operators are especially useful in generating an event report at \nfault inception and then generating another later if a breaker failure condition \noccurs. For example, at the inception of a ground fault, pickup indicator 51G \nasserts and an event report is generated:\n\nER = ... + /51G + ... = logical 1  (for one processing interval)\nEven though the 51G pickup indicator will remain asserted for the duration of \nthe ground fault, the rising-edge operator / in front of 51G (/51G) causes \nsetting ER to be asserted for only one processing interval. In this example, if \nthere was no rising-edge operator on 51G, the ER equation would remain at \nlogical 1 while a fault is present. This would prevent the relay from seeing a \nsubsequent logical 0 to logical 1 transition for a new trigger condition, such as \n51Q asserting.\nFalling-edge operators \\ are also used to generate event reports. See Figure F.2 \nfor more information on falling-edge operators.\n\nTRI (Trigger Event Report) and PUL (Pulse Output Contact) Commands\nThe sole function of the TRI serial port command is to generate standard \nevent reports, primarily for testing purposes.\n\nThe PUL command asserts the output contacts for testing purposes or for \nremote control. If any output contact asserts via the PUL command, the relay \ntriggers a standard event report. The PUL command is available at the serial \nport and the relay front-panel CNTRL pushbutton.\n\nSee Section 10: Communications and Figure 11.3 for more information on the \nTRI (Trigger Event Report) and PUL (Pulse Output Contact) commands.\n\nBack-to-Back Event Report Capability\nThe SEL-311C is capable of recording successive “back-to-back” event \nreports for as many as 360 cycles. When back-to-back events are triggered, the \nrelay shortens the prefault portion of the latter event report(s).\nFigure 12.1 shows an example of back-to-back event report behavior with \nfactory-default Global settings LER = 15 cycles and PRE = 4 cycles. When \nthe first event report is triggered, the relay records data from 4-cycles before \nthe trigger to 11 cycles after the trigger.

The next event \nreport trigger received after the end of the 11 cycle post trigger recording \nperiod is processed in one of two ways.\n\n➤ If the next trigger processed is within the 4-cycle (PRE) period \nfrom the end of the previous event report, the second event \nreport shall contain less than 4-cycles of pretrigger data, and \nthe second event report analog data shall be a continuation of \nthe first event report.\n\n➤ If the next trigger is processed beyond the 4-cycle (PRE) \nperiod from the end of the previous event report, the second \nevent report shall contain the usual 4 cycles of PRE data, and \nthere will be an unrecorded period between the event reports.\n\nFigure 12.1 Example Behavior for Back-to-Back Event Reports\n\nStandard Event \nReport Summary\n\nEach time the relay generates a standard event report, it also generates a \ncorresponding event summary (see Figure 12.2).

The \nidentifiers, date, time and unique event identification number information is at \nthe top of the standard event report, and the other information follows at the \nend. See Figure 12.7.\n\nEvent Number\nThe Event Number = field shows the unique event identification number of the \nevent. The unique event identification number of any event can be found by \nissuing a HIS E command (see HIS Command (Event Summaries/History) on \npage 10.48 for details).\nThe example event summary in Figure 12.2 corresponds to the full-length \nstandard 15-cycle event report in Figure 12.7.\n\nSEL-311                            Date: 10/14/10 Time: 08:53:34.926\nSTATION A\nFID=SEL-311C-2-Rxxx-Vx-Zxxxxxx-Dxxxxxxxx       CID=xxxx\nEvent Number = 10522\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nEvent: BCG T Location: 48.84  Shot:    Frequency:  60.01\nTargets: ZONE1\nCurrents (A Pri), ABCNGQ:    200  2478  2480     0   212  4294\n\nFigure 12.2 Example Event Summary\n\nThe relay sends long event summaries to all serial ports with setting AUTO = \nY each time an event triggers. The long event summary contains more \ninformation than the standard event report summary. See SUM Command \n(Long Summary Event Report) on page 10.72.\nThe latest event summaries are stored in nonvolatile memory and are accessed \nby the HIS (Event Summaries/History) command.\n\nEvent Type\nThe Event: field shows the event type. The possible event types and their \ndescriptions are shown in the table below. Note the correspondence to the \npreceding event report triggering conditions (see Standard Event Report \nTriggering on page 12.3).\n\nNOTE: Figure 12.7 is on multiple \npages.\n\nNOTE: If programmable targets are \nbeing used, it is possible the TARGETS \nfield in an event summary could \nexceed the usual limit of 80 \ncharacters (1 line). In order to support \nall SEL software, the display of \nTARGETS continues on the same line \npast the 80 character limit.\n\nTable 12.2 Event Types (Sheet 1 of 2)\n\nEvent Type Description\n\nAG, BG, CG Single phase-to-ground faults.

If the fault locator \ndoes not operate successfully, just TRIP or ER is displayed.\nThe event type logic uses the Fault Identification Selection (FIDS) logic Relay \nWord bits FSA, FSB, and FSC to help determine the fault type, and to select \nthe appropriate fault location method. See Front-Panel Target LEDs on \npage 5.47 for a description of LEDs A, B, and C, and for more information on \nthe target logic function.\n\nFault Location\nThe relay reports the fault location if the EFLOC setting = Y and the fault \nlocator operates successfully after an event report is generated. If the fault \nlocator does not operate successfully, $$$$$$ is listed in the field. If \nEFLOC = N, the field is blank. Fault location is based upon the line \nimpedance settings Z1MAG, Z1ANG, Z0MAG, and Z0ANG; and \ncorresponding line length setting LL. See the SET command in Table 9.2 and \ncorresponding Line Settings on page SET.7 for information on the line \nparameter settings.\n\nFault Detector Elements\nThe fault locator algorithm uses the distance elements plus overcurrent \nelements 50P1–50P4, 50G1–50G4, 67Q1–67Q4, 51P, 51G, and 51Q as fault \ndetectors. If any of these overcurrent elements are set to low pickup values for \nuse as load indicators, they may be asserted during non-fault conditions. In \nthis situation, even though these elements are not being used for tripping the \nrelay, they may still affect the operation of the fault locator, because the start \nof the disturbance may be unclear.\n\nFault Locator Operating Window\nThe SEL-311C uses a 15-cycle subset of the event report data to calculate the \nevent type and fault location. For Global setting LER = 30, LER = 60, and \nLER = 180 the relay processes the portion of stored data that includes the \nevent report trigger. For LER = 15, the entire event report is available for \ncalculation of the event type and fault location. The relay calculates fault \nlocation using a number of event report rows from the 15-cycle subset. When \nthe fault evolves, the fault location is calculated using rows that represent the \npredominant fault type.\n\nIt is possible for the event type or fault location to be calculated from a \ndifferent portion of the event report than expected. For example (with default \nsettings), when the event report is first triggered by overcurrent element \npickup (ER = /M2P+/Z2G+/51G+/51Q+/50P1+/LOP), but the trip occurs \nmore than 12 cycles later, the conditions at the time of trip are not considered \n\nTRIP Assertion of Relay Word bit TRIP (fault locator could not operate success-\nfully to determine the phase involvement, so just TRIP is displayed).\n\nER SELOGIC control equation setting ER.\nPhase involvement is indeterminate.\n\nTRIG Execution of TRIGGER command.\n\nPULSE Execution of PULSE command.\n\nTable 12.2 Event Types (Sheet 2 of 2)\n\nEvent Type Description\n\nNOTE: The fault locator will not \noperate properly unless three-phase \nvoltages are connected.\n\nNOTE: The fault locator is most \naccurate when the fault currents last \nlonger than two cycles.\n\n\n\n12.8\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nStandard Event Reports and SER\nStandard 15/30/60/180-Cycle Event Reports\n\n(unless covered by a new event report). If the fault type changed between \npickup and tripping, the event type may not match the front-panel target \nLEDs. See Front-Panel Target LEDs on page 5.47 for details on the target \nLED operation.\n\nTargets\nThe relay displays the front-panel targets that are asserted at the end of the \nevent report if a trip occurred during the event. If the relay does not support \nprogrammable targets, the targets that can be reported include: TIME, \nCOMM, SOTF, 51, ZONE1, ZONE2, ZONE3, and ZONE4.\n\nIf the relay supports with programmable target LEDs, the alias of only those \nLEDs set to latch-in on trip (LEDnL=Y) will be displayed. \nIf there is no rising edge of TRIP in the report, the Targets field is blank. See \nFront-Panel Target LEDs on page 5.47.\n\nCurrents\nThe Currents (A pri), ABCNGQ: field shows the currents present in the event \nreport row that was used to calculate fault location or one and one quarter \ncycle after the event trigger if the fault locator does not operate. The listed \ncurrents are:\n\n➤ Phase (A = channel IA, B = channel IB, C = channel IC)\n➤ Neutral ground (N = channel IN)\n➤ Calculated residual (G = IG = 3I0; calculated from channels IA, \n\nIB, and IC)\n➤ Negative-sequence (Q = 3I2; calculated from channels IA, IB, \n\nand IC)\n\nEvent History (HIS) The event history gives you a quick look at recent relay activity. The SEL-311C \nlabels each new event in reverse chronological order with 1 as the most recent event. \nIf the E parameter is used with the HIS command the event number is replaced by a \nunique event identification number from 10000 to 65535 and events are displayed in \nchronological order (see HIS Command (Event Summaries/History) on page 10.48 \nfor details). The unique identifier increments by 1 for each new event. See \nFigure 12.3 for a sample event history.\n\nThe event history contains the following:\n\n➤ Standard report header\n➣ Relay and terminal identification\n➣ Date and time of report\n\n➤ Event history data for each stored event report. Column \nheading text shown in (parenthesis).\n➣ Event number (#) or unique event identification (#)\n➣ Event date and time (DATE, TIME)\n➣ Event type (EVENT)\n➣ Location of fault (LOCAT) (if applicable) \n➣ Maximum phase current from summary fault data (CURR)\n➣ Power system frequency at the time of the event report \n\ntrigger (FREQ)\n➣ Active group at the trigger instant (GRP)\n\n\n\n12.9\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nStandard Event Reports and SER\nStandard 15/30/60/180-Cycle Event Reports\n\n➣ Reclosing relay shot count (SHOT)\n➣ Targets recorded with the event (TARGETS).

The long event report contains more \ninformation than is available from the HIS command, but is shorter than the \nfull event report retrieved with the EVE or CEV commands. The long \nsummary event report contains the following information:\n\n➤ Standard report header\n➣ Relay and terminal identifiers (settings RID and TID)\n➣ Date and time when the event was triggered\n\n➤ Event Information\n➣ Event type\n➣ Fault location\n➣ Breaker trip time\n➣ Unique event identification number from the HIS E command\n➣ Recloser shot count at the trigger time\n➣ System frequency at trigger time\n➣ Active settings group\n➣ Breaker close time\n➣ Targets\n➣ Breaker status (open or closed)\n➣ Phase currents (IA, IB, IC), phase voltages (VA, VB, VC), \n\ncalculated residual ground (IG = 3I0), current IN, and \nnegative-sequence (3I2) currents, along with phase angles \nfor prefault and fault quantities.\n\n➣ Fault location and fault impedance data\n➣ MIRRORED BITS® status if MIRRORED BITS are enabled\n\nEvent Type\nThe Event: field shows the event type (see Event Type on page 12.6 for details).\n\nFault Location\nThe Location: field displays the fault location determined by the relay. If \nEFLOC  = Y and the fault locator operates successfully after an event report is \ngenerated, the relay displays the event location. If the fault locator does not \noperate successfully, the relay displays $$$$$$$ (see Fault Location on \npage 12.7 for details.\n\nBreaker Trip Time\nThe Trip Time: field displays the breaker trip time. If Relay Word bit TRIP is \nasserted when the event is triggered, the trip time is equivalent to the trigger \ntime. If TRIP asserts after the event is triggered, the assertion time of TRIP is \ndisplayed as the trip time. If TRIP does not assert during an event, the trip \ntime is displayed as --:--:--.---.\n\nUnique Event Identification Number\nThe event summary field displays the unique event identification number. \n\nRecloser Shot Count\nThe Shot: field displays the shot count at the time of the event trigger. If \nreclosing is not enabled or is not active this field is blank.\n\n\n\n12.11\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nStandard Event Reports and SER\nStandard 15/30/60/180-Cycle Event Reports\n\nSystem Frequency\nThe Freq: field displays the system frequency at the time the event is triggered.\n\nActive Settings Group\nThe Group: field displays the number of the active settings group at the time \nthe event is triggered.\n\nBreaker Close Time\nThe Close Time: field displays the breaker close time. If Relay Word bit \nCLOSE is asserted when the event is triggered, the close time is equivalent to \nthe trigger time. If CLOSE asserts after the event is triggered, the assertion \ntime of CLOSE is reported as the close time. If CLOSE does not assert during \nan event, the close time is reported as --:--:--.---.\n\nTargets\nThe Targets: field displays the front-panel targets that are asserted at the end \nof the event report if a trip occurred during the event. If the relay is equipped \nwith programmable target LEDs, the alias of only those LEDs set to latch-in \non trip (LEDnL=Y) is displayed (see Targets on page 12.8 for details).\n\nBreaker Status\nThe Breaker: field displays the status of the breaker at the end of the event. If \nRelay Word bit 52A is asserted, the relay reports the breaker Closed. If Relay \nWord bit 52A is not asserted, the relay reports the breaker Open.\n\nAnalog Phase Quantities\nThe Prefault: field displays the IA, IB, IC, IN, IG, 3I2, and voltages from \nthe first row of the event report.\n\nThe Fault: field displays IA, IB, IC, IN, IG, 3I2, VA, VB, and VC that \ncorrespond to the event report rows used for fault location, or, if the fault \nlocator does not operate successfully, from the event report rows 1.25 cycles \nafter the event report is triggered. All angles are referenced to the prefault \nA-phase voltage if it is greater than 13V secondary. Otherwise, angles are \nreferenced to the prefault A-phase current.\n\nFault Location and Fault Impedance Data\nThe relay calculates and displays fault location and fault impedance data, \nincluding distance to the fault in the units of group setting LL, impedance to \nthe fault location in secondary ohms, line angle to the fault location, and \ndistance to the fault in per-unit of line length.\n\nIn addition, the relay also calculates fault resistance in secondary ohms. The \nfault resistance is associated with the fault type; phase-to-ground fault \nimpedance for a single-phase-to-ground fault, phase-to-phase fault impedance \nfor a fault involving two or more phases, including phase-to-phase-to-ground \nand three-phase faults.\n\nIf the relay does not calculate a valid fault location, then these fields will \ndisplay dollar signs ($$$$$$).\nSee Appendix R: Fault Location and Supplemental Fault Location and \nImpedance Data for additional details on fault location.\n\n\n\n12.12\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nStandard Event Reports and SER\nStandard 15/30/60/180-Cycle Event Reports\n\nMIRRORED BITS Status\nThe status of MIRRORED BITS channels are displayed by the SUM command. The \nMIRRORED BITS display includes channel A and B transmit/receive bits at the time \nthe event was triggered, channel A and B transmit/receive bits at the time the relay \ntripped (if a trip occurred during the event), and channel A and B MIRRORED BITS \nchannel indicators (LBOKA, LBOKB, CBADA, CBADB, RBADA, RBADB, \nROKA, and ROKB). If MIRRORED BITS are not enabled, this section is omitted \nfrom the SUM command response. If only one MIRRORED BITS channel is \nenabled, MIRRORED BITS information for both channels, A and B, is displayed \n(see Appendix H: MIRRORED BITS Communications for details on MIRRORED BITS.\n\nCOMTRADE File \nFormat Event Reports\n\nThe SEL-311C stores high-resolution raw data oscillography in binary format and \nuses COMTRADE file types to output these data:\n\n➤ .HDR—header file\n\n➤ .CFG—configuration file\n\n➤ .DAT—high-resolution raw data file\n\nThe .HDR file contains summary information about the event in ASCII \nformat. The .CFG file is an ASCII configuration file that describes the layout \nof the .DAT file.

The format of the \nbinary data files is sample number, time stamp, data value for each analog \nchannel, and digital channel status data for each sample in the file. There are \nno data separators in the binary file, and the file contains no carriage \nreturn/line feed characters. The sequential position of the data in the binary \nfile determines the data translation. Refer to the IEEE Standard Common \nFormat for Transient Data Exchange (COMTRADE) for Power Systems, IEEE \nC37.111–1999 for more information. Many programs read the binary \nCOMTRADE files. These programs include the ACSELERATOR Analytic \nAssistant and ACSELERATOR QuickSet.\n\nRetrieving COMTRADE Event Files\nCOMTRADE files are available as read-only files that can be retrieved using \nACSELERATOR QuickSet, the FILE command and Ymodem file transfer, \nEthernet File Transfer Protocol (FTP), or Manufacturing Messaging \nSpecification (MMS). MMS is only available in models that support IEC \n61850 and only when IEC 61850 is enabled (E61850 = Y). See FIL Command \non page 10.43, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and MMS File Transfer on \npage 10.24, and FTP and MMS File Structure on page 10.25 for additional \ninformation.\n\nRetrieving \nFull-Length Standard \nEvent Reports\n\nThe latest event reports are stored in nonvolatile memory. Each event report \nincludes four sections:\n\n➤ Current, voltage, memory voltage, station battery, and \nfrequency\n\n➤ Protection, control, and communications elements\n\n➤ Event summary\n\n➤ Group, SELOGIC control equations, and Global settings from \nthe time of event trigger\n\nUse the EVE command to retrieve the reports. There are several options to \ncustomize the report format. The general command format is:\n\nEVE  [n Sx Ly L R A D V C M P]\nwhere:\n\nn Event number (n = 1, 2, 3... to number of events stored) or \nunique event identifier (n = 10000–65535). Defaults to 1 if not \nlisted, where 1 is the most recent event.\n\nSx Display x samples per cycle (4, 16, 32, or 128); defaults to 4 if \nnot listed. S128 is only available for unfiltered (raw) event \nreports and must be accompanied by the R parameter (EVE \nS128 R).\n\nLy Display y cycles of data (1–LER). Defaults to LER value if \nnot listed. Unfiltered reports (R parameter) display one extra \ncycle of data, and S128 unfiltered reports display two extra \ncycles of data.\n\nL Display 32 samples per cycle; same as the S32 parameter. \nR Specifies the unfiltered (raw) event report. Defaults to 32 \n\nsamples per cycle unless overridden with the Sx parameter.\nA Specifies that only the analog section of the event is displayed \n\n(current, voltage, memory voltage, station battery, and \nfrequency).\n\nNOTE: Compressed ASCII Event \nReports contain all of the Relay Word \nbits and automatic variable analog \nscaling, and are easily analyzed using \nno-charge software. Regular, \nuncompressed event reports only \ncontain a subset of the Relay Word \nbits, do not have automatic variable \nscaling, and are not fully supported by \nsoftware. SEL recommends that you \nuse compressed event reports for all \nevent analysis. See Compressed ASCII \nEvent Reports on page 12.17.\n\n\n\n12.15\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nStandard Event Reports and SER\nStandard 15/30/60/180-Cycle Event Reports\n\nBelow are example EVE commands.\n\nIf an event report is requested that does not exist, the relay responds:\n\nInvalid Event\n\nIf the Sx parameter is entered and x is not 4, 16, 32, or 128, the relay responds:\n\nOnly 4, 16, 32, or 128 samples per cycle allowed\n\nIf the Ly parameter is entered and y = 0 or y > LER, the relay shall responds:\n\nEvent report length exceeded\n\nSynchrophasor-Level \nAccuracy in Event \nReports\n\nThe SEL-311C provides the option to display event report data aligned to a \nhigh-accuracy time source by adding the P parameter. The header indicates the \navailability of a high-accuracy time source by displaying the status of Relay \nWord bit TSOK. The Time: value in the header includes three additional \ndigits. These represent 100 s, 10 s, and 1 s. The Time: value contains the \ntime stamp of the analog value associated with the trigger point.\n\nD Specifies that only the digital section (Protection and Control \nElements) of the event is displayed.\n\nV Specifies variable scaling for analog values.\nC Display the report in Compressed ASCII format, with analog \n\ndata at 16 samples per cycle, and digital data at 4 samples per \ncycle default.\n\nM Specifies only the Communication element section of the \nevent is displayed.\n\nP Precise to synchrophasor level accuracy for signal content at \nnominal frequency. This option is available only for event \ntriggered when TSOK = logical 1. The P option implies R as \nonly raw analog data are available with this accuracy. When \nM or D are specified with P, then the P option is ignored \nbecause it only pertains to analog data.\n\nSerial Port \nCommand\n\nDescription\n\nEVE Display the most recent event report at 1/4 cycle resolution. \n\nEVE 2 Display the second event report at 1/4 cycle resolution.\n\nEVE S16 L10 Display 10 cycles of the most recent report at 1/16 cycle resolution.\n\nEVE C 2 Display the second report in Compressed ASCII format at, with \nanalog data at 16 samples per cycle, and digital data at 4 samples \nper cycle.\n\nEVE L Display most recent report at 1/32-cycle resolution.\n\nEVE R Display most recent report at 1/32-cycle resolution; analog data and \ndigital data (for optoisolated inputs) are unfiltered (raw).\n\nEVE 2 D L10 Display 10 cycles of the protection and control elements section of \nthe second event report at 1/4-cycle resolution.\n\nEVE 2 A R S4 V Display the unfiltered analog section of the second event report at \n1/4-cycle resolution, with variable scaling of the analog values.\n\n\n\n12.16\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nStandard Event Reports and SER\nStandard 15/30/60/180-Cycle Event Reports\n\nFurthermore, the FREQ column in the analog section of the report is replaced \nby a DT column. DT means “difference time.” It represents the difference time \nin units of microseconds from another row. The trigger point shall have a DT \nvalue of 0000 because the trigger time corresponds to the time displayed in the \nevent report header. The DT value for rows preceding the trigger point is \nreferenced to the following row (so they increment backwards in time). The \nDT value for rows following the trigger point is referenced to the previous row \n(so they increment forwards in time). If TSOK = logical 0, this event report \ndisplay option is not available.\n\nFigure 12.6 shows how an event report is modified with the P parameter. \nBecause event report information is stored at a sample rate that depends on the \npower system frequency, the DT column data will show a minimally changing \nnumber when the power system frequency is stable. If the power system \nfrequency changes during the event reporting window and the relay is \nconnected to a voltage reference, the sample rate may vary during the event \nreport, and the DT values may vary accordingly.\n\n=>>EVE P<Enter>\n\n=>>EVE P<Enter>\nSEL-311C                         Date: 7/12/10 Time: 08:54:29.577\nSTATION A\n\nFID=SEL-311C-2-Rxxx-Vx-Zxxxxxx-Dxxxxxxxx     CID=[XXXX]\nEvent Number=10526\n\nCurrents (Amps Pri)            Voltages (kV Pri)         V1\nIA    IB    IC    IN    IG     VA     VB     VC     VS    Mem  FREQ Vdc \n\n[0]\n   130   781  -941    -8   -30   76.8   54.9 -131.2   -0.0    ...  1043  23\n  -317   963  -701   -10   -54   31.5   93.9 -127.1   -0.0    ...  1041  23\n  -607   979  -393    -8   -21  -20.8  123.1 -100.8   -0.0    ...  1046  23\n  -896   828    17    -9   -51  -68.0  131.3  -65.8    0.0  -90.4  1040  23\n  -996   594   372   -10   -29 -106.5  119.4  -11.5    0.0    ...  1040  23\n  -956   201   712    -9   -43 -127.6   91.9   33.9    0.0    ...  1044  23\n  -802  -146   907    -8   -41 -129.9   45.9   84.2    0.0    ...  1043  23\n  -459  -553   979    -9   -33 -112.7   -1.4  113.5   -0.0  -95.6  1040  23\n.\n.\n.\n[4]\n   158   763  -953   -10   -31   79.8   51.5 -130.8   -0.0    ...  1040  23\n  -291   955  -724   -11   -60   34.9   91.3 -128.0   -0.0    ...  1039  23\n  -291   955  -724   -11   -60   34.9   91.3 -128.0   -0.0    ...  1039  23\n  -585   982  -419    -8   -21  -17.2  121.8 -103.1    0.0    ...  1043  23\n  -884   843   -12    -9   -52  -64.8  131.3  -68.9    0.0  -87.7  1041  23\n  -991   617   347    -8   -27 -104.3  120.9  -15.1   -0.0    ...  1043  23\n  -963   230   692    -7   -41 -126.7   94.5   30.3    0.0    ...  1042  23\n  -819  -118   896    -9   -40 -130.4   49.2   81.5    0.0    ...  1044  23\n  -482  -528   980    -9   -30 -114.6    2.4  111.6    0.0  -98.1  1046  23\n  -170  -790   912    -8   -48  -80.4  -51.2  130.3    0.0    ...  1039  23\n   279  -985   683    -9   -23  -35.5  -91.2  127.6    0.0    ...  1040  23\n   574 -1012   380   -10   -58   16.6 -121.8  102.8   -0.0    ...  1041  23\n   872  -875   -29   -11   -32   64.2 -131.4   68.9   -0.0   87.3  1043  23\n   981  -650  -383    -9   -51  103.6 -121.2   15.3    0.0    ...  1042  23\n   955  -263  -731   -10   -40  126.3  -95.0  -30.3   -0.0    ...  1041  23\n   811    85  -936    -9   -40  130.2  -49.7  -81.6   -0.0    ...  1046  23\n   476   497 -1022   -10   -49  114.6   -3.0 -111.9   -0.0   98.4  0000  23>\n[5]\n   165   759  -956   -10   -32   80.6   50.6 -130.7   -0.0    ...  1040  23\n  -283   955  -726   -10   -54   35.8   90.7 -128.2   -0.0    ...  1043  23\n  -580   982  -424    -9   -22  -16.5  121.5 -103.6    0.0    ...  1038  23\n  -881   847   -17    -9   -51  -64.0  131.3  -69.7   -0.0  -87.0  1043  23\n.\n.\n.\n=>>\n\nFigure 12.6 Example Synchrophasor–Level Precise Event Report 1/16-Cycle \nResolution\n\n\n\n12.17\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nStandard Event Reports and SER\nStandard 15/30/60/180-Cycle Event Reports\n\nCompressed ASCII \nEvent Reports\n\nThe SEL-311C provides Compressed ASCII event reports to facilitate event \nreport storage and display. The SEL communications processors, \nACSELERATOR QuickSet, and the SEL-5601 Analytic Assistant software take \nadvantage of the Compressed ASCII format. Use the EVE C command or \nCEVENT command to display Compressed ASCII event reports. See the \nCEVENT command discussion in Appendix K: Compressed ASCII \nCommands for further information. You can also use the Tools > Events > \nGet Events menu in ACSELERATOR QuickSet to collect events.\nCompressed ASCII event reports are the preferred method for retrieving event \ndata, because the machine-readable format allows the use of time-saving \nsoftware. Standard ASCII event reports are best-suited for rapid analysis, and \nfor situations where only a portion of the event data is under study.\n\nFiltered and \nUnfiltered Event \nReports\n\nThe SEL-311C samples the basic power system measurands (ac voltage and \nac current) 128 times per power system cycle. The relay filters the measurands \nat 32 samples per cycle to remove transient signals. The relay operates on the \nfiltered values and reports them in the event report.\n\nTo view the raw inputs to the relay, select the unfiltered event report (e.g., \nEVE R or CEV R). Use the unfiltered event reports to observe:\n\n➤ Power system harmonics on channels IA, IB, IC, IN, VA, VB, \nVC, VS\n\n➤ Decaying dc offset during fault conditions on IA, IB, IC\n\n➤ Optoisolated input contact bounce updated at 16 samples/cycle\n\n➤ Transients on the station dc battery channel Vdc (power input \nterminals Z25 and Z26), updated at 16 samples /cycle\n\nThe filters for ac current and voltage and station battery are fixed. You can \nadjust the optoisolated input debounce via debounce settings (see Figure 7.1 \nand Figure 7.2).\nRaw event reports display one extra cycle of data at the beginning of the report \n(or two extra cycles when S128 is specified).\n\nRetrieving Event \nReports Via Ethernet \nFile Transfer\n\nSelected event reports are available as read-only files that can be retrieved \nusing Ethernet File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or Manufacturing Messaging \nSpecification (MMS). MMS is only available in models that support \nIEC 61850 and only when IEC 61850 is enabled (E61850 = Y). See File \nTransfer Protocol (FTP) and MMS File Transfer on page 10.24 and MMS on \npage P.4 for additional information.\n\nThe Ethernet file server EVENTS folder contains two types of files for each \nevent stored in the relay.\n\n➤ Compressed, 4 sample/cycle, filtered event, equivalent to \nissuing a CEV command. These files are named C4.nnnnn.cev, \nwhere nnnnn is the unique event identifier.\n\n➤ Compressed, 128 sample/cycle, unfiltered event, equivalent to \nissuing a CEV R S128 command. These files are named \nCR.nnnnn.cev, where nnnnn is the unique event identifier.\n\nThe date and time displayed for events are from the time of event trigger. The \ntimes are UTC.\n\nNOTE: Compressed ASCII Event \nReports contain all of the Relay Word \nbits and automatic variable analog \nscaling, and are easily analyzed using \nno-charge software. Regular, \nuncompressed event reports only \ncontain a subset of the Relay Word \nbits, do not have automatic variable \nscaling, and are not fully supported by \nsoftware. SEL recommends that you \nuse compressed event reports for all \nevent analysis.\n\nNOTE: When a properly rated ac \ncontrol signal is applied to an \noptoisolated input, the unfiltered \nevent report data for that input have \nan asserting/deasserting pattern at \ntwice the applied signal frequency. \nSee Input Debounce Timers on \npage 7.3. The status of extra I/O board \noptoisolated inputs is available only in \nCompressed ASCII event reports.\n\n\n\n12.18\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nStandard Event Reports and SER\nStandard 15/30/60/180-Cycle Event Reports\n\nThe EVENTS folder also contains the event history with unique event \nidentification number (equivalent to the HIS E command) and the compressed \nevent history (equivalent to the CHIS command). See Event History (HIS) on \npage 12.8 and CHISTORY Command on page K.4.\n\nClearing Standard \nEvent Report Buffer\n\nVia Serial Port\nThe HIS C command clears the event summaries and corresponding standard \nevent reports from nonvolatile memory. The HIS C command does not reset \nthe unique event identification number to 10000. See Section 10: \nCommunications for more information on the HIS (Event \nSummaries/History) command.\n\nVia DNP or Modbus\nThe DNP binary output DRST_HIS can be used to reset the event summaries \nand corresponding standard event reports from nonvolatile memory, and is \nsimilar in function to the HIS C command. See Appendix L: DNP3 \nCommunications for more details.\n\nThe Modbus protocol can be used to reset the event summaries and \ncorresponding standard event reports from nonvolatile memory, with functions \nsimilar to the HIS C command. Two methods are available:\n\n➤ Writing to the Reset History Data output coil.\n\n➤ Writing a specific analog value to the RSTDAT register.\n\nSee Appendix O: Modbus RTU and TCP Communications for details.\n\nReset Via SELOGIC Control Equation\nThe RST_HIS SELOGIC control equation setting can be used to reset the event \nsummaries and corresponding standard event reports from nonvolatile \nmemory. The relay resets the function when the setting first asserts (rising \nedge, e.g., a logical 0 to a logical 1 transition).\n\nStandard Event \nReport Column \nDefinitions\n\nRefer to the example event report in Figure 12.7 to view event report columns. \nThis example event report displays rows of information each 1/4 cycle and \nwas retrieved with the EVE command.\n\nThe columns contain ac current, ac voltage, station dc battery voltage, \nfrequency, output, input, and protection and control element information.\n\nCurrent, Voltage, and Frequency Columns\nTable 12.3 summarizes the event report current, voltage, and frequency \ncolumns.\n\nNOTE: The unique event \nidentification number cannot be reset.\n\nNOTE: Figure 12.7 is on multiple \npages.\n\n\n\n12.19\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nStandard Event Reports and SER\nStandard 15/30/60/180-Cycle Event Reports\n\nNote that the ac values change from plus to minus (–) values in Figure 12.7, \nindicating the sinusoidal nature of the waveforms.\n\nOther figures help in understanding the information available in the event \nreport current columns.\n\nFigure 12.8: shows how event report current column data relates to the \nactual sampled current waveform and RMS current values.\n\nFigure 12.9: shows how event report current column data can be \nconverted to phasor rms current values.\n\nVariable Scaling for Analog Values\nThe following example shows the difference between two cycles of the analog \nvalues of an event report without variable scaling (command EVE) and with \nvariable scaling (command EVE V). Variable scaling event reports display \ndata for currents less than 10 A with two decimal places and data for voltages \nless than 10 kV with three decimal places.\n\nExample without variable scaling (EVE):\n=>>EVE <Enter>\nSEL-311                           Date: 05/16/10    Time: 13:13:14.233\nSTATION A\nFID=SEL-311C-2-Rxxx-Vx-Zxxxxxx-Dxxxxxxxx       CID=xxxx\nEvent Number=18195\n      Currents (Amps Pri)            Voltages (kV Pri)         V1\n    IA    IB    IC    IN    IG     VA     VB     VC     VS    Mem  FREQ Vdc\n[1]\n   -37    -1    34    -1    -4  -13.9   -0.1   12.2   -1.4    0.0 60.00   0\n    20   -41    20     0    -1    8.0  -16.0    6.9 -134.2    0.0 60.00   0\n    36     0   -34     1     2   13.9    0.1  -12.2    1.3    0.0 60.00   0\n   -21    40   -20    -0    -1   -8.1   16.0   -6.9  134.1    0.0 60.00   0\n[2]\n   -37    -1    34    -1    -4  -13.9   -0.1   12.2   -1.4    0.0 60.00   0\n    20   -40    20     0     0    8.0  -16.0    6.9 -134.2    0.0 60.00   0\n    36     0   -34     1     2   13.8    0.1  -12.2    1.3    0.0 60.00   0\n   -21    40   -20    -0    -1   -8.1   16.0   -6.9  134.2    0.0 60.00   0\n\nTable 12.3 Standard Event Report Current, Voltage, and Frequency Columns\n\nColumn \nHeading\n\nDefinition\n\nIA Current measured by channel IA (primary A)\nIB Current measured by channel IB (primary A)\nIC Current measured by channel IC (primary A)\nIN Current measured by channel IN (primary A)\nIG Calculated residual current IG = 3I0 = IA + IB + IC (primary A)\nVA Voltage measured by channel VA (primary kV)\nVB Voltage measured by channel VB (primary kV)\nVC Voltage measured by channel VC (primary kV)\nVS Voltage measured by channel VS (primary kV)\n\nV1MEM Positive-sequence memory voltage\n\nVdc Voltage measured at power input terminals Z25 and Z26 (Vdc)\nFreqa\n\na Not available with P parameter.\n\nSystem frequency (Hz)\nDTb\n\nb Only available with P parameter.

See Table D.2 for more information on Relay \nWord bits shown in Table 12.4.\n\nTo limit report size, the SEL-311C does not include all Relay Word bits in a \nstandard ASCII event report. Some examples are logic variables LV1–LV32, \nremote bits RB17–RB32, optoisolated inputs IN209–IN216 and virtual bits \nVB001–VB128. These and all other Relay Word bits are available in \nCompressed ASCII event reports, and are viewable using PC software. See \nCompressed ASCII Event Reports on page 12.17 for more information.\n\nNOTE: The “V” option has no effect \nfor compressed event reports (EVE C) \nbecause the analog values \nautomatically have variable scaling. \nVariable scaling for compressed data \ndisplays both currents less than \n1000 A and voltages less than \n1000 kV with three decimal places.\n\nTable 12.4 Output, Input, Protection, and Control Element Event Report Columns (Sheet 1 of 8)\n\nColumn Heading\nCorresponding \n\nElements (Relay \nWord Bits)\n\nSymbol Definition\n\nAll columns .

For example, setting SER1 contains:\n\n➤ time-overcurrent element pickups (51Q and 51G)\n➤ instantaneous overcurrent element (50P1)\n\nThus, any time one of these overcurrent elements picks up or drops out, the \nrelay time-tags the change in the SER.\n\nEach entry in the SER includes SER row number, date, time, element name, \nand element state.\n\nThe SER stops recording all Relay Word bits except ALARM, HALARM, \nHALARML, SETCHG, and GRPSW when the relay is disabled.\n\nAutomatic SER Triggers\nThe SEL-311C automatically logs special SER entries as shown in Table 12.5. \nThere are no SER trigger settings associated with these automatic SER trigger \nentries.\n\nTable 12.5 Automatic SER Triggers \n\nEvent SER Entry Reference\n\nPower-up Relay newly powered \nup\n\nSection 9: Setting the Relay\n\nSettings change, active \ngroup change, or CID file \nuploaded\n\nRelay settings \nchanged\n\nSection 9: Setting the Relay, \nSection 7: Inputs, Outputs, \nTimers, and Other Control \nLogic, and Appendix P: IEC \n61850\n\nActive settings group \nchanged\n\nRelay group changed Section 7: Inputs, Outputs, \nTimers, and Other Control \nLogic\n\nSER C command issued SER archive cleared Clearing SER Report on \npage 12.30\n\nStart of SER data loss SER data loss begin SER Memory Operation on \npage 12.30End of SER data loss SER data loss end\n\nInvalid SER data Invalid Data\n\nData overwritten while \nrelay is responding to SER \ncommand\n\nCommand aborted, \ndata overwrite \noccurred\n\nDiagnostic restart Diagnostic restart Section 13: Testing and \nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\n12.29\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nStandard Event Reports and SER\nSequential Events Recorder (SER) Report\n\nAll of the automatic SER entries except “Invalid Data” include a date and time \nstamp.\n\nMaking SER Trigger \nSettings\n\nEnter as many as 24 element names in each of the SER settings via the SET R \ncommand. See Table D.1 for references to valid relay element (Relay Word \nbit) names. See the SET R command in Table 9.2 and corresponding Report \nSettings (Serial Port Command SET R) on page SET.36. Use commas or \nspaces to delimit the elements. For example, if you enter setting SER1 as:\n\nSER1 = 51P,51G,51PT,,51GT  ,   50P1,    , 50P2\n\nThe relay displays the setting as:\n\nSER1 = 51P,51G,51PT,51GT,50P1,50P2\n\nThe relay can monitor as many as 72 elements in the SER (24 in each of \nSER1, SER2, and SER3).\n\nMake SER Settings \nWith Care\n\nThe relay triggers a row in the Sequential Events Recorder (SER) event report \nfor any change of state in any one of the elements listed in the SER1, SER2, or \nSER3 trigger settings. Nonvolatile memory is used to store the latest \n1024 rows of the SER event report so they can be retained during power loss. \nThe nonvolatile memory is rated for a finite number of “writes.” Exceeding \nthe limit can result in an EEPROM self-test failure. An average of one state \nchange every three minutes can be made for a 25-year relay service life.\n\nRetrieving SER \nReports\n\nThe relay saves the latest 1024 rows of the SER in nonvolatile memory. Row 1 \nis the most recently triggered row, and row 1024 is the oldest. View the SER \nreport by date or SER row number as outlined in the examples below.\n\nExample SER Serial \nPort Commands\n\nFormat\n\nSER If SER is entered with no numbers following it, all available \nrows are displayed (to row number 1024). They display with \nthe oldest row at the beginning (top) of the report and the latest \nrow (row 1) at the end (bottom) of the report. Chronological \nprogression through the report is down the page and in \ndescending row number.\n\nSER 17 If SER is entered with a single number following it (17 in this \nexample), the first 17 rows are displayed, if they exist. They \ndisplay with the oldest row (row 17) at the beginning (top) of \nthe report and the latest row (row 1) at the end (bottom) of the \nreport. Chronological progression through the report is down \nthe page and in descending row number.\n\nSER 10  33 If SER is entered with two numbers following it (10 and 33 in \nthis example; 10 < 33), all the rows between (and including) \nrows 10 and 33 are displayed, if they exist. They display with \nthe oldest row (row 33) at the beginning (top) of the report and \nthe latest row (row 10) at the end (bottom) of the report. Chron-\nological progression through the report is down the page and in \ndescending row number.\n\nSER 47  22 If SER is entered with two numbers following it (47 and 22 in \nthis example; 47 > 22), all the rows between (and including) \nrows 47 and 22 are displayed, if they exist. They display with \nthe newest row (row 22) at the beginning (top) of the report and \nthe oldest row (row 47) at the end (bottom) of the report. \nReverse chronological progression through the report is down \nthe page and in ascending row number.\n\n\n\n12.30\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nStandard Event Reports and SER\nSequential Events Recorder (SER) Report\n\nThe date entries in the above example SER commands are dependent on the \nDate Format setting DATE_F. If setting DATE_F = MDY, then the dates are \nentered as in the above examples (Month/Day/Year). If setting DATE_F = \nYMD, then the dates are entered Year/Month/Day.\n\nIf the requested SER event report rows do not exist, the relay responds:\n\nNo SER Data\n\nClearing SER Report Clear the SER report from nonvolatile memory with the SER C command as \nshown in the following example:\n\n=>SER C <Enter>\nClear the SER\nAre you sure (Y/N) ? Y <Enter>\nClearing Complete\n\nTo indicate when the SER memory was cleared, an entry is added to the SER \nas shown in Table 12.5.\n\nSER Memory \nOperation\n\nThe Sequential Events Recorder (SER) nonvolatile memory is updated soon \nafter new SER data are generated. During some conditions, such as during \nevent report capture, the update of SER data is momentarily interrupted, and \nthen SER updating of nonvolatile memory resumes.\n\nIn rare cases with rapidly occurring SER triggers, the new SER information \nmay arrive faster than the memory system can store it. When this occurs, the \nrelay inserts a pair of entries in the SER to indicate the start and end of data \nloss, as shown in Table 12.5. This is normally seen only during testing. \nNormal SER operation resumes after the data loss.\n\nSER 3/30/2009 If SER is entered with one date following it (date 3/30/2009 in \nthis example), all the rows on that date are displayed, if they \nexist. They display with the oldest row at the beginning (top) of \nthe report and the latest row at the end (bottom) of the report, \nfor the given date. Chronological progression through the \nreport is down the page and in descending row number.\n\nSER 2/17/2009\n3/23/2009\n\nIf SER is entered with two dates following it (date 2/17/2009 \nchronologically precedes date 3/23/2009 in this example), all \nthe rows between (and including) dates 2/17/2009 and \n3/23/2009 are displayed, if they exist. They display with the \noldest row (date 2/17/2009) at the beginning (top) of the report \nand the latest row (date 3/23/2009) at the end (bottom) of the \nreport. Chronological progression through the report is down \nthe page and in descending row number.\n\nSER 3/16/2009\n1/5/2009\n\nIf SER is entered with two dates following it (date 3/16/2009 \nchronologically follows date 1/5/2009 in this example), all the \nrows between (and including) dates 1/5/2009 and 3/16/2009 \nare displayed, if they exist. They display with the latest row \n(date 3/16/2009) at the beginning (top) of the report and the \noldest row (date 1/5/2009) at the end (bottom) of the report. \nReverse chronological progression through the report is down \nthe page and in ascending row number.\n\nExample SER Serial \nPort Commands\n\nFormat\n\nNOTE: The SEL-311C accepts two or \nfour digit years in the SER command. \nFor example, SER 3/30/09 is treated \nthe same as SER 3/30/2009. In either \ncase, the SER report only displays \ntwo digit years in the Date column.\n\nNOTE: If any elements change state \nduring the clearing process, the SER \nentries for these elements may be \nreported with time stamps that are \nprior to the SER archive cleared \nmessage.\n\n\n\n12.31\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nStandard Event Reports and SER\nExample Standard 15-Cycle Event Report\n\nAnother situation that can affect SER data storage is when the power supply to \nthe SEL-311C is interrupted while data are being recorded. If this results in \nincomplete data, the SER Command may report Invalid Data for the \nincomplete entry, as shown in Table 12.5. Normal SER operation resumes \nafter the relay is powered-up.\n\nExample Standard 15-Cycle Event Report\nThe following example standard 15-cycle event report in Figure 12.7 also \ncorresponds to the example sequential events recorder (SER) report in \nFigure 12.10. The circled numbers in Figure 12.7 correspond to the SER row \nnumbers in Figure 12.10. The row explanations follow Figure 12.10.\n\nIn Figure 12.7, the arrow (>) in the column following the Vdc column \nidentifies the “trigger” row. This row corresponds to the Date and Time values \nat the top of the event report.\n\nThe asterisk (*) in the column following the Vdc column identifies the row \ncorresponding to the “fault” values, which are determined from the filtered \nvalues. The phase currents are calculated from the row identified with the \nasterisk and the row one quarter-cycle previous (see Figure 12.8 and \nFigure 12.9). These currents are listed at the end of the event report in the \nevent summary. If the “trigger” row (>) and the faulted phase current row (*) \nare the same row, the (*) symbol takes precedence.\nBecause the phase currents are determined from the filtered values, the \nasterisk (*) is not displayed in the unfiltered (raw) event report.\n\n\n\n12.32\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nStandard Event Reports and

Included are discussions on testing philosophies, \nmethods, and tools. Relay self-tests and troubleshooting procedures are shown \nat the end of the section.\n\nThe topics discussed in this section include the following:\n\n➤ Testing Philosophy\n\n➤ Testing Methods and Tools on page 13.4\n\n➤ Relay Self-Tests on page 13.7\n➤ Relay Troubleshooting on page 13.8\n\n➤ Relay Calibration on page 13.13\n\n➤ Factory Assistance on page 13.13\n\nTesting Philosophy\nProtective relay testing may be divided into three categories: acceptance, \ncommissioning, and maintenance.\n\nThe categories are differentiated by when they take place in the life cycle of \nthe relay as well as in the test complexity.\n\nThe paragraphs below describe when to perform each type of test, the goals of \ntesting at that time, and the relay functions that you need to test at each point. \nThis information is intended as a guideline for testing SEL relays.\n\nAcceptance Testing When: When qualifying a relay model to be used on the utility system.\nGoals:\n\n1. Ensure relay meets published critical performance \nspecifications such as operating speed and element accuracy.\n\n2. Ensure that the relay meets the requirements of the intended \napplication.\n\n3. Gain familiarity with relay settings and capabilities.\n\nWhat to test: All protection elements and logic functions critical to the \nintended application.\n\n\n\n13.2\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nTesting and Troubleshooting\nTesting Philosophy\n\nSEL performs detailed acceptance testing on all new relay models and versions. We \nare certain the relays we ship meet their published specifications. It is important for \nyou to perform acceptance testing on a relay if you are unfamiliar with its operating \ntheory, protection scheme logic, or settings. This helps ensure the accuracy and \ncorrectness of the relay settings when you issue them.\n\nTimed Trip Tests\nThe SEL-311C supervises some trips for as many as two cycles with a \ndisturbance detector. This can affect trip times for elements not associated \nwith a change of current, for manual trips, and for elements with intentional \ndelays. See Section 5: Trip and Target Logic for more information about \ndisturbance detector supervision.\n\nCommissioning \nTesting\n\nWhen: When installing a new protection system.\n\nGoals:\n1. Ensure that all system ac and dc connections are correct.\n\n2. Ensure that the relay functions as intended using your settings.\n\n3. Ensure that all auxiliary equipment operates as intended.\n\nWhat to test: All connected or monitored inputs and outputs, polarity and \nphase rotation of ac connections, simple check of protection elements.\n\nSEL performs a complete functional check and calibration of each relay \nbefore it is shipped. This helps ensure that you receive a relay that operates \ncorrectly and accurately. Commissioning tests should verify that the relay is \nproperly connected to the power system and all auxiliary equipment. Verify \ncontrol signal inputs and outputs. Check breaker auxiliary inputs, SCADA \ncontrol inputs, and monitoring outputs. Use an ac connection check to verify \nthat the relay current and voltage inputs are of the proper magnitude and phase \nrotation. Verify that all SELOGIC® programming operates as intended.\n\nBrief fault tests ensure that the relay settings are correct. It is not necessary to \ntest every relay element, timer, and function in these tests.\n\nAt commissioning time, use the relay METER command to verify the ac \ncurrent and voltage magnitude and phase rotation. Use the PULSE command \nto verify relay output contact operation. Use the TARGET command to verify \noptoisolated input operation.\n\nMaintenance Testing When: At regularly scheduled intervals or when there is an indication of a \nproblem with the relay or system.\n\nGoals:\n1. Ensure that the relay is measuring ac quantities accurately.\n\n2. Ensure that scheme logic and protection elements are \nfunctioning correctly.\n\n3. Ensure that auxiliary equipment is functioning correctly.\n\nWhat to test: Anything not shown to have operated during an actual fault \nwithin the past maintenance interval.\n\n\n\n13.3\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nTesting and Troubleshooting\nTesting Philosophy\n\nSEL relays use extensive self-testing capabilities and feature detailed metering \nand event reporting functions that lower the utility dependence on routine \nmaintenance testing.\n\n1. Use the SEL relay reporting functions as maintenance tools.\n\nPeriodically verify that the relay is making correct and accurate \ncurrent and voltage measurements by comparing the relay \nMETER output to other meter readings on that line. \n\n2. Review relay event reports in detail after each fault. \n\nUsing the event report current, voltage, and relay element data, \nyou can determine that the relay protection elements are \noperating properly. \n\nUsing the event report input and output data, you can determine \nthat the relay is asserting outputs at the correct instants, that all \ncontact inputs are operating, and that auxiliary equipment is \noperating properly. \n\n3. At the end of your maintenance interval, the only items that \nneed testing are those that have not operated during the \nmaintenance interval.\n\nThe basis of this testing philosophy is simple: If the relay is correctly set and \nconnected, is measuring properly, and no self-test has failed, there is no reason \nto test it further.\n\nEach time a fault occurs the protection system is tested. Use event report data \nto determine areas requiring attention. Slow breaker auxiliary contact \noperations and increasing or varying breaker operating time can be detected \nthrough detailed analysis of relay event reports.\n\nBecause SEL relays are microprocessor-based, their operating characteristics \ndo not change over time. Time-overcurrent operating times are affected only \nby the relay settings and applied signals. It is not necessary to verify operating \ncharacteristics as part of maintenance checks.\n\nAt SEL, we recommend that maintenance tests on SEL relays be limited under \nthe guidelines provided above. The time saved may be spent analyzing event \ndata and thoroughly testing those systems that require more attention.\n\n\n\n13.4\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nTesting and Troubleshooting\nTesting Methods and Tools\n\nTesting Methods and Tools\nTest Features \nProvided by the Relay\n\nThe features shown in Table 13.1 assist you during relay testing.\n\nLow-Level Test \nInterface\n\nThe SEL-311C has a low-level test interface between the calibrated input \nmodule and the separately calibrated processing module. You may test the \nrelay in either of two ways:\n\n➤ By applying ac current signals to the relay inputs\n\n➤ By applying low magnitude ac voltage signals to the low-level \ntest interface\n\nAccess the test interface of the processing module by removing the relay front panel.\n\nFigure 2.20 shows the location of the processing module input connector (J12) \nfor low-level test interface connections. The output connector (J2) of the input \nmodule is below connector J12.\n\nFigure 13.1 shows the low-level test interface (J2 and J12) connector \ninformation. Table 13.2 shows the output (J2) value of the input module (for a \ngiven input value into the relay rear panel). The processing module input (J12) \nhas a maximum 9 V p-p voltage damage threshold. Remove the ribbon cable \nbetween the two modules to access the outputs (J2) of the input module and \nthe inputs (J12) to the processing module (relay main board).\nYou can test the relay-processing module (via input J12) using signals from \nthe SEL-4000 Relay Test System. The power supply for the relay mainboard \nis provided through the ribbon cable between J2 and J12. SEL cable C724 is \nused to connect one, two, or three relays to the SEL-4000 Relay Test System \n\nTable 13.1 Helpful Commands for Relay Testing \n\nCommand Description\n\nMETER The METER command shows the ac currents and voltages (magnitude and phase angle) presented to the relay in pri-\nmary values. In addition, the command shows power system frequency (FREQ) and the voltage input to the relay \npower supply terminals (VDC). Compare these quantities against other devices of known accuracy. The METER com-\nmand is available at the communications ports and front-panel display. See Section 10: Communications and \nSection 11: Front-Panel Interface. Metering data are also available through the ACSELERATOR QuickSet® SEL-5030 \nsoftware and the web server. See Using the Embedded Web Server (HTTP) on page 10.22.\n\nEVENT The relay generates a 15-, 30-, 60-, or 180-cycle event report in response to faults or disturbances. Each report contains \ncurrent and voltage information, relay element states, and input/output contact information. If you question the relay \nresponse or your test method, use the event report for more information. The EVENT command is available at the \ncommunications ports. See Section 12: Standard Event Reports and SER. Event reports can also be gathered using \nACSELERATOR QuickSet. \n\nSER The relay provides a Sequential Events Recorder (SER) event report that time tags changes in relay element and \ninput/output contact states. The SER provides a convenient means to verify the pickup/dropout of any element in the \nrelay. The SER command is available at the communications ports. See Section 12: Standard Event Reports and SER. \nSER data can also be gathered using ACSELERATOR QuickSet or the web server. See Using the Embedded Web Server \n(HTTP) on page 10.22.\n\nTARGET Use the TARGET command to view the state of relay control inputs, relay outputs, and relay elements individually \nduring a test. The TARGET command is available at the communications ports and the front panel. See Section 10: \nCommunications and Section 11: Front-Panel Interface. Relay element status can also be viewed using the Targets \nscreen of the ACSELERATOR QuickSet HMI or the web server. See Using the Embedded Web Server (HTTP) on \npage 10.22.\n\nPULSE Use the PULSE command to test the contact output circuits. The PULSE command is available at the communica-\ntions ports and the front panel. Section 10: Communications. Contact outputs can also be pulsed through the Control \nwindow of the ACSELERATOR QuickSet HMI.\n\nNOTE: The SEL-4000 Relay Test \nSystem, which includes the SEL \nAdaptive Multichannel Source, \nappropriate cables, and PC software, \nis specifically designed for use with \nthe low-level test interface.\n\nThe relay contains devices sensitive \nto Electrostatic Discharge (ESD). \nWhen working on the relay with the \nfront panel removed, work surfaces \nand personnel must be properly \ngrounded or equipment damage may \nresult.\n\n! CAUTION\n\nNever apply voltage signals greater \nthan 9 V peak-peak to the low-level \ntest interface (J12) or equipment \ndamage may result.\n\n! CAUTION\n\n\n\n13.5\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nTesting and Troubleshooting\nTesting Methods and Tools\n\nwhile maintaining the power supply connection. The cable has six connectors: \nthree connectors with 10 conductors (power supply connector), two \nconnectors with 12 conductors, and one connector with 34 conductors (analog \nconnectors). Each power supply connector is connected to one of the three \nanalog connectors through a 10-conductor ribbon cable. For each relay, install \none of the power supply connectors into J2 of the input module. Install the \ncorresponding analog connector into J12 of the relay main board. Connect the \nmale DB-25 connector to the SEL Adaptive Multichannel Source. Table 13.2 \nshows the resultant signal scale factor information for the calibrated input \nmodule. These scale factors are used in the SEL-5401 program, which is part \nof the SEL-4000.\n\nYou can test the input module two different ways:\n1. Remove the ribbon cable from the input module (output J1). \n\nMeasure the outputs from the input module with an accurate \nvoltmeter (measure signal pin to GND pin), and compare the \nreadings to accurate instruments in the relay input circuits, or\n\n2. Replace the ribbon cable, press the front-panel METER \npushbutton, and compare the relay readings to other accurate \ninstruments in the relay input circuits.\n\nFigure 13.1 Low-Level Test Interface (J2 or J12) Connector\n\nScale factor calculation examples:\n\nLogic and Protection \nElement Test Methods\n\nTest the pickup and dropout of relay elements using one of three methods: \ntarget command indication, output contact closure, or sequential events \nrecorder (SER).\nThe examples below show the settings necessary to route the phase \ntime-overcurrent element 51PT to the output contacts and the SER. The 51PT \nelement, like many in the SEL-311C, is controlled by enable settings and/or \ntorque control SELOGIC control equations. To enable the 51PT element, set \nthe E51P enable setting and 51PTC torque control settings to the following:\n\nE51P = Y (via the SET command)\n51PTC = 1 (set directly to logical 1, via the SET L command)\n\nTable 13.2 Resultant Scale Factors for Input Module \n\nInput Channels\n(Relay Rear \n\nPanel)\n\nInput Channel\nNominal \nRating\n\nInput \nValue\n\nCorresponding\nJ1 Output \n\nValue\n\nScale Factor\n(Input/Output)\n\nIA, IB, IC, IN 1 A 1 A 45.6 mV 21.92 A/V\n\nIA, IB, IC, IN 5A 5 A 45.2 mV 110.60 A/V\n\nVA, VB, VC, VS 300 V 67 VLN 299.1 mV 223.97 V/V\n\n+5V\n\nBATT_DIF\n\nGND GNDGNDGND\n\nVSN/CN/CN/C IA\n\nGND\n\nIBIC\n\nGND GNDGND\n\nVAVB\n\nGND\n\nVC\n\nGND\n\nN/C\n\nGND\n\nBATT_COM\n\n+5V\n\nBATT_RET\n\n+5V\n\nGND\n\n+15V\n\nGND\n\n+15V\n\nIN\n\nGND\n\n67 V\n0.2911 V\n---------------------- 223.97 V\n\nV\n----  =\n\n5 A\n0.045 V\n------------------- 110.60 A\n\nV\n----  =\n\n\n\n13.6\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nTesting and Troubleshooting\nTesting Methods and Tools\n\nTesting Via Target Commands\nDisplay the state of relay elements, inputs, and outputs using the front-panel \nor communications port TAR commands. Use this method to verify the \npickup settings of protection elements.\n\nTesting With the Front-Panel TAR Command\nAccess the front-panel TAR command from the front-panel OTHER pushbutton \nmenu. To display the state of the 51PT element on the front-panel display, \npress the OTHER pushbutton, cursor to the TAR option, and press SELECT. Press \nthe Up Arrow pushbutton until TAR 28 is displayed on the top row of the LCD. \nThe bottom row of the LCD displays all elements asserted in Relay Word \nRow 28. The relay maps the state of the elements in Relay Word Row 28 on \nthe bottom row of LEDs. The 51PT element state is reflected on the LED \nlabeled RS. See Table D.1 for the correspondence between the Relay Word \nelements and the TAR command.\n\nTesting With the Communications Port TAR Command\nTo view the 51PT element status from the communications port, issue the \nTAR 51PT command. The relay will display the state of all elements in the \nRelay Word row containing the 51PT element.\n\nReview TAR command descriptions in Section 10: Communications and \nSection 11: Front-Panel Interface for further details on displaying element \nstatus via the TAR commands.\n\nRelay element status can also be viewed using the Targets screen of the \nACSELERATOR QuickSet HMI or on the web server. See Using the Embedded \nWeb Server (HTTP) on page 10.22.\n\nTesting Via Output Contacts\nYou can set the relay to operate an output contact for testing a single element. \nUse the SET L command (SELOGIC control equations) to set an output \ncontact (e.g., OUT101–OUT107) to the element under test. The available elements \nare the Relay Word bits referenced in Table D.1.\n\nUse this method especially for time testing time-overcurrent elements. For \nexample, to test the phase time-overcurrent element 51PT via output contact \nOUT104, make the following setting:\n\nOUT104 = 51PT\n\nTime-overcurrent curve and time-dial information can be found in Section 9: \nSetting the Relay. \n\nDo not forget to reenter the correct relay settings when you are finished testing \nand ready to place the relay in service.\n\nTesting Via Sequential Events Recorder\nYou can set the relay to generate an entry in the Sequential Events Recorder \n(SER) for testing relay elements. Use the SET R command to include the \nelement(s) under test in any of the SER trigger lists (SER1 through SER3). \nSee Section 12: Standard Event Reports and SER.\n\nTo test the phase time-overcurrent element 51PT with the SER, make the \nfollowing setting:\n\nSER1 = 51P  51PT\n\n\n\n13.7\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nTesting and Troubleshooting\nRelay Self-Tests\n\nElement 51P asserts when phase current is above the pickup of the phase \ntime-overcurrent element. Element 51PT asserts when the phase \ntime-overcurrent element times out. The assertion and deassertion of these \nelements is time-stamped in the SER report. Use this method to verify timing \nassociated with time-overcurrent elements, reclosing relay operation, etc. \n\nDo not forget to reenter the correct relay settings when you are ready to place \nthe relay in service.\n\nCommunications Test \nMethods\n\nThe TEST DB command provides a method to override Relay Word bits or \nanalog values to facilitate testing of communications interfaces. The \ncommand overwrites values in the communications interfaces (SEL Fast \nMessages, DNP, Modbus®, and IEC 61850) only. The actual values used by \nthe relay for protection and control are not overridden. See TEST DB \nCommand on page 10.75.\n\nRelay Self-Tests\nThe relay runs a variety of self-tests. Hardware alarm conditions are generated \nby the self-test logic and are classified as warnings or failures, depending on \nseverity. The relay may take the following actions for out-of-tolerance \nconditions (see Table 13.3):\n\n➤ Relay Word bits HALARMP and HALARM assert for five seconds \nto indicate that a hardware warning has occurred. Relay Word bits \nHALARML and HALARM assert and remain asserted to indicate \nmost hardware failures. Table 13.3 lists the various hardware \nwarning and failure conditions. Some hardware failures prevent the \nrelay from operating. In such cases, Relay Word bits HALARML \nand HALARM do not assert.\n\nOnce HALARMP pulses, Relay Word bit HALARMA \ncontinues to assert for approximately five seconds once per \nminute to indicate that a hardware warning has occurred. \nHALARMA continues to pulse until it is reset by pulsing \nSELOGIC control equation RST_HAL, DNP binary output \nDRST_HAL, or the Modbus Reset Hardware Alarm coil. \nRestarting the relay also resets HALARMA. HALARMP does \nnot assert again for the same alarm condition, unless the \ncondition is cleared and returns.\n\nDepending on SELOGIC control equation settings, the ALARM \noutput contact may signal an alarm condition for hardware \nwarnings. The ALARM output is always de-energized for \nhardware failures, regardless of settings. See Output Contacts \non page 7.33 for an explanation of ALARM contact operation \nfor various SELOGIC settings and hardware configurations.\n\n➤ Protection Disabled: The relay disables protection and control \nelements and trip/close logic. All output contacts are \nde-energized. The EN front-panel LED is extinguished.\n\n➤ The relay generates automatic STATUS reports at the \ncommunications port for warnings and failures (ports with \nsetting AUTO = Y).\n\nNOTE: The SEL-311C is shipped from \nthe factory with the ALARM output \nconfigured as a B contact.\n\n\n\n13.8\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nTesting and Troubleshooting\nRelay Troubleshooting\n\n➤ The relay displays failure messages on the relay LCD display \nfor failures.\n\n➤ For certain failures, the relay automatically restarts as many as \nthree times within 24 hours. In many instances, this will correct \nthe failure. A “diagnostic restart” entry is recorded in the \nSequential Events Recorder (SER), but the automatic restart \nmay occur before Relay Word bits ALARM, HALARM, and \nHALARML are recorded in the SER and before front-panel \nfailure messages are displayed.\n\nUse the communications port STATUS command or front-panel STATUS \npushbutton to view relay self-test status. Based on the self-test type, issue the \nSTA C command as directed in the Corrective Actions column. Contact SEL \nif this does not correct the problem or if the relay directs you to do so in \nresponse to the STA C.\n\nRelay Troubleshooting\nInspection Procedure Complete the following procedure before disturbing the relay. After you finish \n\nthe inspection, proceed to Troubleshooting Procedure on page 13.10.\n\nStep 1. Measure and record the power supply voltage at the power \ninput terminals.\n\nStep 2. Check to see that the power is on. Do not turn the relay off.\n\nStep 3. Measure and record the voltage at all control inputs.\n\nStep 4. Measure and record the state of all output relays.\n\nTable 13.3 Relay Self-Tests (Sheet 1 of 3)\n\nSelf Test Description\nNormal \nRange\n\nAlarm \nRelay Word \n\nBits\n\nProtection \nDisabled \n\non Failurea\n\nPort Auto \nMessage \non Failure\n\nFront-Panel \nMessage on \n\nFailure\n\nCorrective \nAction\n\nI/O Board Failure Invalid interface \nboard ID or relay \n\nsettings do not \nmatch installed \ninterface boards\n\nHALARML Yes Yes STATUS FAIL \nIO_BRD FAIL\n\nSTA C\n\nI/O Board \nWarning\n\nActual and \nexpected board \n\nIDs do not match.\n\nHALARMP, \nHALARMA\n\nNo Yes STATUS \nWARNING \n\nIO_BRD \nWARNING\n\nSTA C\n\nTemperature –40°C to \n100°C\n\nHALARMP, \nHALARMA\n\nNo Yes\n\nCommunications \nBoard Warning\n\nInstalled \ncommunications \n\ncard does not \nmatch relay Part \n\nNumber\n\nNo Yes STA C\n\nCommunications \nBoard Failure\n\nCommunications \nboard has failed\n\nNo Yes STATUS FAIL \nCOM BRD \nWARNING\n\nSTA C\n\nUSB Board \nWarning\n\nInstalled USB \nboard does not \n\nmatch relay Part \nNumber\n\nNo No STATUS \nWARNING \n\nUSB WARNING\n\nSTA C\n\n\n\n13.9\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nTesting and Troubleshooting\nRelay Troubleshooting\n\nUSB Board \nFailure\n\nUSB \ncommunications \nboard has failed\n\nNo No STATUS FAIL \nUSB FAILURE\n\nSTA C\n\nFPGA FPGA fails to \nprogram \n\nHALARML Yes Yes\n\nFPGA FPGA failure HALARML Yes Yes STATUS FAIL \nFPGA FAILURE\n\nAutomatic \nrestart. \nContact \nSEL if \nfailure \nreturns.\n\nRTC Chip Unable to \ncommunicate with \n\nclock, or clock \nfails time keeping \n\ntest\n\nHALARMP, \nHALARMA\n\nNo No\n\nHMI Invalid HMI \nboard ID\n\nHALARMP, \nHALARMA\n\nNo Yes STATUS \nWARNING \n\nHMI WARNING\n\nHMI HMI timeout HALARMP, \nHALARMA\n\nNo Yes STATUS \nWARNING \n\nHMI WARNING\n\nExternal Ram Failure of \nread/write test on \n\nsystem RAM\n\nYes No\n\nInternal/External \nRAM\n\nFailure of internal \nor external RAM\n\nHALARML Yes Yes STATUS FAIL \nRAM FAILURE\n\nAutomatic \nrestart. \nContact \nSEL if \nfailure \nreturns.\n\nCode Flash \nFailure\n\nFailure of \nchecksum test on \n\nfirmware code\n\nYes No\n\nCode Flash \nFailure\n\nFirmware relay \ntype code does not \n\nmatch part \nnumber\n\nHALARML Yes Yes STATUS FAIL \nROM FAILURE\n\nVerify \ncorrect \n\nversion of \nfirmware \ninstalled\n\nOperating \nSystem\n\nOperating System \ncheck fails\n\nYes Yes CPU \nERROR/RELAY \n\nDISABLED\n\nAutomatic \nrestart. \nContact \nSEL if \nfailure \nreturns.\n\nData Flash \nFailure\n\nFailure of \nchecksum test on \n\nrelay settings\n\nHALARML Yes Yes STATUS FAIL \nFLASH \n\nFAILURE\n\nEEPROM Failure Failure to \ndetermine latch \n\nbit status on \npower-up\n\nHALARML Yes Yes STATUS FAIL \nEEPROM \nFAILURE\n\nTable 13.3 Relay Self-Tests (Sheet 2 of 3)\n\nSelf Test Description\nNormal \nRange\n\nAlarm \nRelay Word \n\nBits\n\nProtection \nDisabled \n\non Failurea\n\nPort Auto \nMessage \non Failure\n\nFront-Panel \nMessage on \n\nFailure\n\nCorrective \nAction\n\n\n\n13.10\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nTesting and Troubleshooting\nRelay Troubleshooting\n\nTroubleshooting \nProcedure\n\nAll Front-Panel LEDs Dark\n1.

Instructions for \nSEL-311C Relays With Ethernet \n\nOverview\nFrom time to time, SEL issues firmware upgrades. The instructions which \nfollow explain how you can install new firmware in your SEL-311C relay with \nEthernet. These instructions are for firmware upgrades only and do not \nprovide complete instructions for part number changes. If a part number \nchange is required, contact SEL for assistance.\n\nThis appendix contains the following subsections:\n\n➤ Upgrading to Digitally Signed Firmware Files\n\n➤ Relay Firmware Upgrade Methods on page B.3\n\n➤ Method One: Using ACSELERATOR QuickSet Firmware Loader \non page B.4\n\n➤ Method Two: Using a Terminal Emulator on page B.9\n\n➤ Method Three: Using a Web Browser on page B.21\n\n➤ Solving Firmware Upgrade Issues on page B.24\n\nUpgrading to Digitally Signed Firmware Files\nThis device supports digitally signed firmware upgrades for firmware version \nR503 and higher. These firmware upgrade files are compressed to reduce file \ntransfer times and digitally signed by SEL using a secure hash algorithm. The \nsignature ensures that the file has been provided by SEL and that its contents \nhave not been altered. Once uploaded to the relay, the signature of the \nfirmware is verified with a public key number that is stored on the relay from \nthe factory. If the relay cannot verify the signature, it rejects the file.\nThe name of the digitally signed firmware file is of the form Rxxx311C.zds, \nwhere Rxxx is the firmware revision number, 311C indicates the relay type, \nand .zds is the file extension reserved for digitally signed files. Firmware files \nwith the .s19 extension are not available for firmware version R503 and \nhigher.\n\nIf you are upgrading a relay from relay firmware version R502 or earlier, \nfollow the Special Instructions for Upgrading from Firmware Version R502 or \nEarlier on page B.2. Otherwise, continue with Relay Firmware Upgrade \nMethods on page B.3.\n\n! CAUTION\nDo not install firmware with a lower \nrevision number than the current \nversion. Changing the firmware from \nR503 or higher to R502 or lower will \ncause the relay to lose calibration.\n\nNOTE: These instructions are for \nupgrading a relay with digitally signed \nfirmware files (.zds file extension). \nProceed to Relay Firmware Upgrade \nMethods on page B.3 if upgrading to \nfirmware with .s19 file extension. \n\nNOTE: Relays with SELBOOT (BFID) \nversion R200 or later only support \nfirmware versions with .zds \nextensions. Firmware versions with \n.s19 extensions are not supported.\n\n\n\nB.2\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nFirmware Upgrade Instructions for SEL-311C Relays With Ethernet\nUpgrading to Digitally Signed Firmware Files\n\nSpecial Instructions \nfor Upgrading from \nFirmware Version \nR502 or Earlier\n\nThe SELBOOT firmware loader in relays shipped with firmware R502 and \nearlier must be upgraded before digitally signed firmware files can be used. The \nprocess for upgrading SELBOOT is similar to Firmware Upgrade Method Two. \n\nTo determine if SELBOOT must be updated, do the following:\n\nStep 1. Establish communication between the relay and a personal \ncomputer, as described in C. Establish Communications With \nthe Relay on page B.5.\n\nStep 2. From the computer, type ID <Enter>.\n\nThe relay responds with the following:\n\n\"FID=SEL-311C-1-Rxxx-V0-Zxxxxxx-Dxxxxxxxx\",\"xxxx\"\n\"BFID=SLBT-3CF1-R102-V0-Zxxxxxx-Dxxxxxxx\",\"xxxxx\"\n\"CID=xxx\",\"xxxx\"\n\"DEVID=xxxxxxx\",\"xxxx\"\n\"DEVCODE=xx\",\"xxxx\"\n\"PARTNO=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\"xxxx\"\n\"SERIALNO=xxxxxxxxxx\",\"xxxx\"\n\"CONFIG=xxxxxxxx\",\"xxxx\"\n\"SPECIAL=xxxxx\",\"xxxx\"\n\nStep 3. Locate the Boot Firmware Identification String (BFID).\nStep 4. Find the SELBOOT revision number in the BFID (Rxxx). If the \n\nrevision number is R102 or earlier, the SELBOOT must be \nupgraded. If the revision number is R200 or later, follow the \ninstructions under Relay Firmware Upgrade Methods on page B.3.\n\nStep 5. To upgrade SELBOOT, locate the new SELBOOT file \n(Rxxx3cfl.s19) on the disc provided with the firmware upgrade \nmaterials. Follow the instructions under Method Two: Using a \nTerminal Emulator on page B.9. At G. Upload New Firmware \non page B.17, Step 1, replace the REC command with REC \nBOOT and follow the prompts. \n\nStep 6. When the relay prompts:\n\nPress any key to begin transfer and then start transfer at the terminal.\n\npress <Enter> and use Step 4 on page B.16 to select the \nSELBOOT file.\n\nStep 7. When the SELBOOT upgrade is successful, the relay prompts:\n\nErasing SELboot.\nWriting SELboot.\nSELboot upload completed successfully.\nRestarting SELboot.\n!>\n\nStep 8. Type EXI <Enter> at the SELBOOT !> prompt to exit \nSELBOOT. The relay should display the = prompt.\n\nStep 9. If the relay does not return to the SELBOOT !> prompt within \ntwo minutes after displaying Restarting SELboot, cycle the \nrelay power. The relay should restart and display the = prompt.\n\nOnce the SELBOOT upgrade is complete, select a firmware upgrade method as \ndiscussed in Relay Firmware Upgrade Methods. To use Method One, go to \nD. Prepare the Relay (Save Relay Settings and Other Data) on page B.5. To \nuse Method Two, go to E. Start SELBOOT on page B.16. It is not necessary to \nsave the relay settings and other data again if you did this before upgrading \nSELBOOT.\n\n\n\nB.3\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nFirmware Upgrade Instructions for SEL-311C Relays With Ethernet\nRelay Firmware Upgrade Methods\n\nRelay Firmware Upgrade Methods\nIntroduction These firmware upgrade instructions apply to SEL-311C relays with at least \n\none Ethernet port.\n\nSEL occasionally offers firmware upgrades to improve the performance of \nyour relay. Changing physical components is unnecessary because the relay \nstores firmware in Flash memory.\n\nA firmware loader program called SELBOOT resides in the relay. To upgrade \nfirmware, use the SELBOOT program to download an SEL-supplied file from a \npersonal computer to the relay via the USB port or a serial port.\n\nThe firmware upgrade can be performed one of three ways:\n\n➤ Method One: Use the Firmware Loader provided within \nACSELERATOR QuickSet® SEL-5030 Software. The Firmware \nLoader automates the firmware upgrade process and is the \npreferred method.\n\n➤ Method Two: Connect to the relay in a terminal session and \nupgrade the firmware using the steps documented in Method \nTwo: Using a Terminal Emulator on page B.9.\n\n➤ Method Three: Establish an Ethernet connection and use a web \nbrowser to access the embedded Web Server. Upgrade the \nfirmware using the steps documented in Method Three: Using \na Web Browser on page B.21. This is the fastest method to \ncomplete an upgrade.\n\nThe same basic actions are required when using any of these methods:\n\nA. Obtain the firmware file\n\nB. Remove relay from service\n\nC. Establish communications with the relay\n\nD. Prepare the relay (save settings and other data)\nE. Start SELBOOT\n\nF. Maximize port baud rate (EIA-232 ports only)\nG. Upload new firmware\n\nH. Check relay self-tests\n\nI. Verify relay settings\n\nJ. Return the relay to service\n\nRequired Equipment\nGather the following equipment before starting this firmware upgrade:\n\n➤ Personal computer\n\n➤ To use Method One, ACSELERATOR QuickSet\n➤ To use Method Two, terminal emulation software that supports \n\n1K Xmodem or Xmodem (these instructions use \nHyperTerminal® from a Microsoft® Windows® operating \nsystem)\n\nNOTE: SEL strongly recommends \nthat you upgrade firmware at the \nlocation of the relay and with a direct \nconnection from the personal \ncomputer to the USB port or one of \nthe relay serial ports. Do not load \nfirmware from a remote location; \nproblems can arise that you will not be \nable to address from a distance. When \nupgrading at the substation, do not \nattempt to load the firmware into the \nrelay through an SEL communications \nprocessor.\n\n\n\nB.4\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nFirmware Upgrade Instructions for SEL-311C Relays With Ethernet\nMethod One: Using ACSELERATOR QuickSet Firmware Loader\n\n➤ Serial communications cable (SEL Cable C234A, SEL C662 \nUSB-to-232 converter, or equivalent) or USB cable (SEL C664 \nor equivalent)\n\n➤ Disc containing the firmware upgrade (.s19) file\n➤ Firmware Upgrade Instructions (these instructions)\n➤ Your relay instruction manual\n\nMethod One: Using ACSELERATOR QuickSet Firmware \nLoader\n\nTo use the ACSELERATOR QuickSet Firmware Loader, you must have \nACSELERATOR QuickSet. See Appendix C: PC Software for instructions on \nhow to obtain and install the software. Once the software is installed, perform \nthe firmware upgrade as follows.\n\nA. Obtain Firmware \nFile\n\nThe firmware file is usually provided on a CD-ROM. Locate the firmware file \non the disc. The file name will be of the form, for example, Rxxx311C.zds, \nwhere Rxxx is the firmware revision number, 311C indicates the relay type, \nand .zds is the firmware file extension. Copy the firmware file to an easily \naccessible location on the PC.\n\nFirmware is designed to be used with specific relays. A list of relay serial \nnumbers is provided as part of the firmware upgrade package. The firmware \nprovided is for use with the listed relays only. Attempts to upgrade relays not \nlisted might not be successful and can result in relay failure.\n\nB. Remove Relay \nFrom Service\n\nStep 1. If the relay is in use, follow your company practices for \nremoving a relay from service. Typically, these include \nchanging settings, or disconnecting external voltage sources or \noutput contact wiring, to disable relay control functions.\n\nStep 2. Apply power to the relay.\n\nStep 3. Connect a communications cable and determine the port speed.\n\nIf using the EIA-232 front port to upgrade firmware, determine \nthe port speed as follows: \n\na. From the relay front panel, press the SET pushbutton.\nb. Use the arrow pushbuttons to navigate to PORT.\nc. Press the SELECT pushbutton.\nd. Use the arrow pushbuttons to navigate to the relay serial \n\nport you plan to use (usually the front port).\ne. Press the SELECT pushbutton.\nf. With SHO selected, press the SELECT pushbutton.\ng. Press the down arrow pushbutton to scroll through the \n\nport settings; write down the value for each setting.\n\nNOTE: Firmware versions R502 and \nearlier have the .s19 file extension.\n\n\n\nB.5\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nFirmware Upgrade Instructions for SEL-311C Relays With Ethernet\nMethod One: Using ACSELERATOR QuickSet Firmware Loader\n\nh. Connect an SEL C234A EIA-232 serial cable, SEL \nC662 USB-to-232 converter, or equivalent \ncommunications cable to the relay serial port and to the \nPC.\n\nIf using the relay front-panel USB port to upgrade firmware, \nconnect an SEL C664 cable between the relay and the PC. The \nUSB port appears as a serial connection. Any baud rate will be \naccepted by the relay.\n\nC. Establish \nCommunications With \nthe Relay\n\nUse the Communications > Parameters menu of ACSELERATOR QuickSet \nto establish a connection. See Appendix C: PC Software for additional \ninformation.\n\nD. Prepare the Relay \n(Save Relay Settings \nand Other Data)\n\nIt is possible for data to be lost during the firmware upgrade process. Follow \nthe steps in this section carefully to ensure that important data are saved.\n\nStep 1. Select Tools > Firmware Loader and follow the on-screen \nprompts. \n\nStep 2. In the Step 1 of 4 window of the Firmware Loader, click the \nellipsis button and browse to the location of the firmware file. \nSelect the file and click Open. See Figure B.1.\n\nFigure B.1 Prepare the Device (Step 1 of 4)\n\nStep 3. Check the Save calibration settings box in the Step 1 of 4 \nwindow of the Firmware Loader. These factory settings are \nrequired for proper operation of the relay and must be reentered \nin the unlikely event they are erased during the firmware \nupgrade process. The Firmware Loader saves the settings in a \ntext file on the PC.\n\nStep 4. Check the Save device settings box if you do not have a copy \nof the relay settings. It is possible for relay settings to be lost \nduring the upgrade process. \n\nStep 5. Check the Save events box if there are any event reports that \nhave not been previously saved. It is possible for event reports \nto be lost during the upgrade process.\n\n\n\nB.6\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nFirmware Upgrade Instructions for SEL-311C Relays With Ethernet\nMethod One: Using ACSELERATOR QuickSet Firmware Loader\n\nStep 6. Click Next.\n\nThe Firmware Loader reads the calibration settings and saves \nthem in a text file on the PC. Make note of the file name and the \nlocation.\n\nIf Save device settings was selected, the Firmware Loader \nreads all of the settings from the relay. The software may ask if \nyou wish to merge the settings read from the relay with existing \ndesign templates on the PC. Click No, do not merge settings \nwith Design Template. The Firmware Loader will suggest a \nname for the settings, but the suggested name can be modified \nas desired.\n\nIf Save events was selected, the Event History window will \nopen to allow the events to be saved.\n\nStep 7. If you use the Breaker Wear Monitor, click the Terminal button \nin the lower left portion of the Firmware Loader to open the \nterminal window. From the Access Level 1 prompt, issue the \nBRE command and record the internal and external trip \ncounters, internal and external trip currents for each phase, and \nbreaker wear percentages for each phase.\n\nStep 8. Enable Terminal Logging capture and issue the following \ncommands to save stored data. It is possible for this data to be \nlost during the firmware upgrade process. (Some of these \nfeatures are not available on all relay models.)\n\na. MET E—accumulated energy metering\nb. MET D—demand and peak demand\nc. MET M—maximum/minimum metering\nd.

Maximize Port \nBaud Rate\n\nThis step is performed automatically by the software.\n\nG. Upload New \nFirmware\n\nThis step is performed automatically by the software. The software will erase \nthe existing firmware and start the file transfer to upload the new firmware. \nUpload progress will be shown in the Transfer Status window.\n\nWhen the firmware upload is complete, the relay will restart. The Firmware \nLoader will automatically re-establish communications and issue a STA \ncommand to the relay.\n\nIn cases where the relay does not restart within two minutes of the firmware upload \ncompletion (as indicated by the PC application), and no error messages appear on \nthe relay HMI, cycle power to the relay. The firmware loader application should then \nresume. Answer Yes if the Firmware Loader prompts you to continue.\n\nH. Check Relay \nSelf-Tests\n\nThe Step 3 of 4 window of the Firmware Loader will indicate that it is \nchecking the device status and when the check is complete (see Figure B.3). \nThe software will notify you if any problems are detected. You can view the \nrelay status by opening the terminal using the Terminal button in the lower left \nportion of the Firmware Loader. If status failures are shown, open the terminal \nand see Solving Firmware Upgrade Issues on page B.24.\n\nClick Next to go to the completion step.\n\n\n\nB.8\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nFirmware Upgrade Instructions for SEL-311C Relays With Ethernet\nMethod One: Using ACSELERATOR QuickSet Firmware Loader\n\nFigure B.3 Load Firmware (Step 3 of 4)\n\nI. Verify Relay \nSettings\n\nIf there are no failures, the relay will enable. In the Step 4 of 4 window (see \nFigure B.4), the Firmware Loader will give you the option to compare the \ndevice settings.

Open the terminal window using the Terminal button in the \nlower left portion of the Firmware Loader. \n\nStep 2. Use the ACC command with the associated password to enter \nAccess Level 1.\n\nStep 3. Issue the ID command and compare the firmware revision (Rxxx) \ndisplayed in the FID string against the number from the firmware \nenvelope label. If the numbers match, proceed to Step 5.\n\n\n\nB.9\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nFirmware Upgrade Instructions for SEL-311C Relays With Ethernet\nMethod Two: Using a Terminal Emulator\n\nStep 4. For a mismatch between a displayed FID and the firmware \nenvelope label, reattempt the upgrade or contact SEL for \nassistance.\n\nStep 5. If you use the Breaker Wear Monitor, type BRE <Enter> to \ncheck the data to see if the relay retained breaker wear data \nthrough the upgrade procedure. If the relay did not retain this \ndata, use the BRE W command to reload the percent contact \nwear values recorded in D. Prepare the Relay (Save Relay \nSettings and Other Data) on page B.5.\n\nStep 6. Apply current and voltage signals to the relay.\n\nStep 7. Type MET <Enter> or use the ACSELERATOR QuickSet HMI \nto verify that the current and voltage signals are correct.\n\nStep 8. Use the TRI and EVE/CEV commands or Tools > Events > \nGet Events menu in ACSELERATOR QuickSet to verify that the \nmagnitudes of the current and voltage signals you applied to \nthe relay match those displayed in the event report. If these \nvalues do not match, check the relay settings and wiring.\n\nStep 9. Autoconfigure the SEL communications processor port if you \nhave an SEL communications processor connected to the relay. \nThis step reestablishes automatic data collection between the \nSEL communications processor and the relay. Failure to \nperform this step can result in automatic data collection failure \nwhen cycling communications processor power.\n\nStep 10. Follow your company procedures for returning a relay to \nservice.\n\nMethod Two: Using a Terminal Emulator\nA. Obtain Firmware \nFile\n\nThe firmware file is usually provided on a CD-ROM. Locate the firmware file \non the disc. The file name will be of the form, for example, Rxxx311C.zds, \nwhere Rxxx is the firmware revision number, 311C indicates the relay type, \nand .zds is the standard firmware file extension. Copy the firmware file to an \neasily accessible location on the PC.\n\nFirmware is designed to be used with specific relays. A list of relay serial \nnumbers is provided as part of the firmware upgrade package. The firmware \nprovided is for use with the listed relays only. Attempts to upgrade relays not \nlisted might not be successful and can result in relay failure. \n\nB. Remove Relay \nFrom Service\n\nStep 1. If the relay is in use, follow your company practices for \nremoving a relay from service. Typically, these include \nchanging settings, or disconnecting external voltage sources or \noutput contact wiring, to disable relay control functions.\n\nStep 2. Apply power to the relay.\n\nStep 3. Connect a communications cable and determine the port speed.\n\nIf using the EIA-232 front port to upgrade firmware, determine \nthe port speed as follows: \n\na. From the relay front panel, press the SET pushbutton.\nb. Use the arrow pushbuttons to navigate to PORT.\nc. Press the SELECT pushbutton.\n\nNOTE: Firmware versions R502 and \nearlier have the .s19 file extension. \n\nNOTE: These instructions can also \nbe used to upgrade the SELBOOT \nfirmware loader. See Upgrading to \nDigitally Signed Firmware Files on \npage B.1 to determine if this is \nnecessary.\n\n\n\nB.10\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nFirmware Upgrade Instructions for SEL-311C Relays With Ethernet\nMethod Two: Using a Terminal Emulator\n\nd.

Press the down pushbutton to scroll through the port \n\nsettings; write down the value for each setting.\nh. Connect an SEL C234A EIA-232 serial cable, SEL \n\nC662 USB-to-232 converter, or equivalent \ncommunications cable to the relay serial port and to the \nPC. \n\nIf using the relay front-panel USB port to upgrade firmware, \nconnect an SEL C664 cable between the relay and the PC. The \nUSB port appears as a serial connection. Any baud rate will be \naccepted by the relay.\n\nC. Establish \nCommunications With \nthe Relay\n\nTo establish communication between the relay and a personal computer, you \nmust be able to modify the computer serial communications parameters (i.e., \ndata transmission rate, data bits, parity) and set the file transfer protocol to \n1K Xmodem or Xmodem protocol.\n\nStep 1. From the computer, open HyperTerminal or other terminal \nemulation software.\n\nOn a personal computer running Windows, you would typically \nclick the Start > Programs > Accessories > \nCommunications.\n\nStep 2. Enter a name, select any icon, and click OK (Figure B.5).\n\nFigure B.5 Establishing a Connection\n\nStep 3. Select the computer serial port you are using to communicate \nwith the relay (Figure B.7) and click OK.\nIf using the relay front-panel USB port, a port driver must be \ninstalled on the PC. See Establishing Communications Using \nthe USB Port on page 10.2. To see what virtual COM port has \nbeen created, launch any communications program that allows \nselection of a COM port and view all available ports, or go to \nthe Windows Device Manager and inspect the available COM \nports as shown in Figure B.6. Use Device Manager to verify \nwhich virtual COM port is associated with a particular physical \nUSB port. Device Manager updates the available COM ports \neach time a cable is inserted or removed.\n\nNOTE: The terminal window of \nACSELERATOR QuickSet can also be \nused to upgrade firmware.\n\n\n\nB.11\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nFirmware Upgrade Instructions for SEL-311C Relays With Ethernet\nMethod Two: Using a Terminal Emulator\n\nFigure B.6 Inspect Available COM Ports\n\nFigure B.7 Determining the Computer Serial Port\n\nStep 4. Establish serial port communications parameters.\n\nIf using the EIA-232 front port to upgrade firmware, the \nsettings for the computer (Figure B.8) must match the relay \nsettings you recorded earlier.\n\na.

Apply current and voltage signals to the relay.\n\nStep 7. Type MET <Enter> to verify that the current and voltage \nsignals are correct.\n\nStep 8. Use the TRI and EVE/CEV commands to verify that the \nmagnitudes of the current and voltage signals you applied to \nthe relay match those displayed in the event report. If these \nvalues do not match, check the relay settings and wiring.\n\nStep 9. Autoconfigure the SEL communications processor port if you \nhave an SEL communications processor connected to the relay. \nThis step reestablishes automatic data collection between the \nSEL communications processor and the relay. Failure to \nperform this step can result in automatic data collection failure \nwhen cycling communications processor power. \n\nStep 10. Follow your company procedures for returning a relay to \nservice.\n\nMethod Three: Using a Web Browser\nA.  Set Port 5 Setting \nHTTPACC to 2\n\nTo Upgrade firmware using the Web Browser, the Port 5 setting HTTPACC \nmust be set to 2. If this setting is set to 2, the FWFPC setting becomes \navailable. FWFPC determines whether front-panel confirmation is required \nfor firmware upgrades and defaults to Y. If FWFPC is set to N, the firmware \nupgrade process takes place without the need for front-panel confirmation. \nSee F. Upload New Firmware on page B.22 for details on the front-panel \nconfirmation process.\n\nB. Obtain Firmware \nFile\n\nFollow instructions under A. Obtain Firmware File on page B.4.\n\nC. Remove Relay \nFrom Service\n\nStep 1. If the relay is in use, follow your company practices for \nremoving a relay from service. Typically, these include \nchanging settings, or disconnecting external voltage sources or \noutput contact wiring, to disable relay control functions.\n\nStep 2. Apply power to the relay.\n\nStep 3. Establish an Ethernet connection to the device. See \nEstablishing Communications Using an Ethernet Port and \nTelnet or the Web Server on page 10.7 for more detailed \ninstructions.\n\nD. Establish \nCommunications With \nthe Relay\n\nEstablish communication between your personal computer and the relay using \na web browser. See Using the Embedded Web Server (HTTP) on page 10.22 \nfor more information. Establish a Telnet session with HyperTerminal (or an \nequivalent) using the TCP/IP connection, with the Host address and Port \nnumber set to match the Port 5 settings IPADDR (e.g., 192.168.1.2) and \nTPORT (e.g. 23), respectively.\n\nE. Prepare the Relay \n(Save Relay Settings \nand Other Data)\n\nUsing the Telnet session, follow D. Prepare the Relay (Save Relay Settings \nand Other Data) on page B.14.\n\n\n\nB.22\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nFirmware Upgrade Instructions for SEL-311C Relays With Ethernet\nMethod Three: Using a Web Browser\n\nF.

This \nappendix shows how to set the protection and control elements (Relay Word \nbits) in the SELOGIC control equations.\nAdditional SELOGIC control equation setting details are available in Section 9: \nSetting the Relay (see also SELOGIC Control Equation Settings (Serial Port \nCommand SET L) on page SET.26). See the SHO Command (Show/View \nSettings) on page 10.61 for a list of the factory-default settings.\n\nRelay Word Bits\nMost of the protection and control element logic outputs shown in the various \nfigures in Section 3 through Section 8 are Relay Word bits (labeled as such in \nthe figures). Each Relay Word bit has a label name and can be in either of the \nfollowing states:\n\n➤ 1 (logical 1)\n➤ or 0 (logical 0)\n\nLogical 1 represents an element being picked up, timed out, or otherwise \nasserted.\n\nLogical 0 represents an element being dropped out or otherwise deasserted.\n\nA complete listing of Relay Word bits and their descriptions are referenced in \nTable D.2.\n\nRelay Word Bit \nOperation Example—\nPhase Time-\nOvercurrent Element \n51PT\n\nAs an example of protection element operation via the logic output of Relay \nWord bits, a phase time-overcurrent element is examined.

Other Relay Word bits (e.g., those for definite-time overcurrent \nelements, voltage elements, frequency elements) behave similarly in their \nassertion or deassertion to logical 1 or logical 0, respectively. The time-\novercurrent elements (like the preceding phase time-overcurrent element \nexample) are rather unique because they have a Relay Word bit (e.g., 51PR) \nthat asserts for the reset state of the element.\n\nRelay Word bits are used in SELOGIC control equations, which are explained \nin the following subsection.\n\nSELOGIC Control Equations\nMany of the protection and control element logic inputs shown in the various \nfigures in Section 3 through Section 8 are SELOGIC control equations (labeled \n“SELOGIC Settings” in most of the figures).

For example, the following SELOGIC control equation setting \nhas two sets of parentheses:\n\nSV7 = (SV7 + IN106) * (50P1 + 50G1)\n\nIn the above example, the logic within the parentheses is processed first and \nthen the two parentheses resultants are ANDed together. The above example is \nfrom Figure 7.26. Parentheses cannot be “nested” (parentheses within \nparentheses) in an SEL-311C SELOGIC control equation setting.\n\nSELOGIC Control Equation NOT Operator !\nThe NOT operator ! is applied to a single Relay Word bit and also to multiple \nelements (within parentheses). Following are examples of both.\n\nExample of NOT Operator ! Applied to Single Element\nThe internal circuit breaker status logic in the SEL-311C operates on 52a \ncircuit breaker auxiliary contact logic. There is one SELOGIC control equation \ncircuit breaker status setting for each pole of a single-pole trip breaker. These \nbreaker SELOGIC control equations are 52AA for Phase A, 52AB for Phase B, \nand 52AC for Phase C. See Optoisolated Inputs on page 7.1 and Close Logic \non page 6.5 for more information on SELOGIC control equation circuit breaker \nstatus settings.\n\nWhen a circuit breaker pole is closed, the 52a circuit breaker auxiliary contact \nfor that pole is closed. When a circuit breaker pole is open, the 52a contact is \nopen.\n\nThe opposite is true for a 52b circuit breaker auxiliary contact. When a circuit \nbreaker pole is closed, the 52b circuit breaker auxiliary contact for that pole is \nopen. When the circuit breaker pole is open, the 52b contact is closed.\n\nIf a 52a contact from the A-phase of a single-pole trip breaker is connected to \noptoisolated input IN101, the SELOGIC control equation circuit breaker status \nsetting for Phase A is set:\n\n52AA = IN101\n\nConversely, if a 52b contact is connected to optoisolated input IN101, the \nSELOGIC control equation circuit breaker status setting for Phase A is set:\n\n52AA = !IN101 [=NOT(IN101)]\n\nOne Processing Interval\n\n\\81D1T\n\n81D1T\n\nOne Processing Interval\n\n\n\nF.7\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nSetting SELOGIC Control Equations\nSELOGIC Control Equations\n\nWith a 52b contact connected, if the circuit breaker is closed, the 52b contact \nis open and input IN101 is de-energized [IN101 = 0 (logical 0)]:\n\n52AA = !IN101 = NOT(IN101) = NOT(0) = 1\nThus, the SELOGIC control equation circuit breaker status setting 52AA \ndetects that the A-phase pole of the circuit breaker is closed.\n\nWith a 52b contact connected, if the circuit breaker is open, the 52b contact is \nclosed and input IN101 is energized [IN101 = 1 (logical 1)]:\n\n52AA = !IN101 = NOT(IN101) = NOT(1) = 0\nThus, the SELOGIC control equation circuit breaker status setting 52AA \ndetects that the A-phase pole of the circuit breaker is open.\n\nExample of NOT Operator ! Applied to Multiple Elements (Within \nParentheses)\n\nThe SELOGIC control equation trip unlatch setting is set as follows:\nULTR = !(50L + 51G)\n\nRefer also to Trip Logic on page 5.1.\n\nIn this factory setting example, the unlatch condition comes true only when \nboth the 50L (phase time-overcurrent element pickup indication) and 51G \n(residual ground time-overcurrent element pickup indication) Relay Word bits \ndeassert:\n\nULTR = !(50L + 51G) = NOT(50L + 51G)\nAs stated previously, the logic within the parentheses is performed first. In this \nexample, the states of Relay Word bits 50L and 51G are ORed together. Then \nthe NOT operator is applied to the logic resultant from the parentheses.\n\nIf either one of 50L or 51G is still asserted [e.g., 51G = 1 (logical 1)], the \nunlatch condition is not true:\n\nULTR = NOT(50L + 51G) = NOT(0 + 1) = NOT(1) = 0\nIf both 50L and 51G are deasserted [i.e., 50L = 0 and 51G = 0 (logical 0)], the \nunlatch condition is true:\n\nULTR = NOT(50L + 51G) = NOT(0 + 0) = NOT(0) = 1\nand the trip condition can unlatch, subject to other conditions in the trip logic \n(see Figure 5.1).\n\nSELOGIC Control \nEquation Operation \nExample—Tripping\n\nIf tripping does not involve communications-assisted or switch-onto-fault trip \nlogic, the SELOGIC control equation trip settings TR, TRQUAL, or BKMTR \nare the only trip settings needed. Refer to Trip Logic on page 5.1.\n\nNote that Figure 5.1 appears quite complex. But because tripping does not \ninvolve communications-assisted or switch-onto-fault trip logic in this \nexample, respective SELOGIC control equation trip settings TRCOMM and \nTRSOTF are not used. The only effective inputs into the logical OR gate that \ngenerates Relay Word bit TRPRM in Figure 5.1 are SELOGIC control equation \ntrip settings TR, TRQUAL, and BKMTR.

If a SELOGIC control equation setting is set \ndirectly to 1, it is always “asserted/on/enabled.” If a SELOGIC control equation \nsetting is set equal to 0, it is always “deasserted/off/disabled.”\n\nUnder the SHO Command (Show/View Settings) on page 10.61, note that a \nnumber of the factory SELOGIC control equation settings are set directly to \n1 or 0.\n\nThe individual SELOGIC control equation settings explanations (referenced in \nSELOGIC Control Equation Settings (Serial Port Command SET L) on \npage SET.26) discuss whether it makes logical sense to set the given SELOGIC \ncontrol equation setting to 0 or 1 for certain criteria.\n\nSet SELOGIC Control Equations Directly to 1 or 0 (Example)\nOf special concern are the SELOGIC control equation torque control settings \n67P1TC–51QTC for the overcurrent elements.

If latch LT1 is \ndeasserted, LV11 cannot assert, and neither can LV12.\n\nTime-Line Description for Figure F.4\nDay 1: The first part of the LV12 equation (LV11 * !TRIP) works like a fast \nrising edge detector, evaluating to logical 1 only when LV11 asserts to trip the \nrelay. This works because the TRIP Relay Word bit is still at logical 0 when \nLV11 first asserts and LV12 is evaluated. In effect, LV12 is processed between \nLV11 and the TR equation. As shown in Figure F.4, the expression LV11 * \n!TRIP is only logical 1 for one processing interval.\n\nNight 1: Once asserted, LV12 remains asserted until TRGTR asserts to break \nthe seal-in condition created by LV12 * !TRGTR.

If this limit must be exceeded, use a logic variable (SELOGIC \ncontrol equation settings LV1–LV32) as an intermediate setting step.\nFor example, assume that the trip equation (SELOGIC control equation trip \nsetting TR) needs more than 30 Relay Word bits in its equation setting. Instead \nof placing all Relay Word bits into TR, program some of them into the \nSELOGIC control equation setting LV1. Next use the resultant SELOGIC \ncontrol equation variable output (Relay Word bit LV1) in the SELOGIC control \nequation trip setting TR.\n\nProcessing Order Considerations\nNote in Table F.4 that the SELOGIC control equation variables (SELOGIC \ncontrol equation settings SV1–SV16) are processed after the trip equation \n(SELOGIC control equation trip setting TR). Thus, any tripping via Relay \nWord bits SV1–SV16 can be delayed as much as 1/4 cycle. For most \napplications, this is probably of no consequence.\n\nHowever, if a Relay Word bit listed later in Table F.4 is used in a SELOGIC control \nequation that is listed earlier in Table F.4 (e.g., in Group 3, TR = SV7 + …), and \nmultiple setting groups are being considered, the Relay Word bit could remain \nasserted through a group change operation and evaluate to logical 1 for the first run \nthrough the SELOGIC control equation processing order in the new setting group.\n\nIn this example, if the SV7 Relay Word bit is asserted just before changing to \nsetting Group 3, the SV7 Relay Word bit remains asserted and the TR \nequation evaluates to logical 1 for one processing interval, causing a relay trip. \nSee SELOGIC Variable and Timer Behavior \nAfter Power Loss, Settings Change, or Group Change on page 7.28.\nA safe method of planning multi-group relay settings is to use variables for the \nsame purpose in each settings group and where critical functions are involved \n(such as breaker open and close operations).\n\nMaximum Total Number of Elements, Rising-Edge, and Falling-Edge \nOperators\n\nThe SELOGIC control equation settings as a whole in a particular setting group \nhave the following limitations:\n\n➤ Total number of elements  537\n➤ Total number of rising-edge or falling-edge operators  49\n\nSELOGIC control equation settings that are set directly to 1 (logical 1) or 0 \n(logical 0) also have to be included in these limitations—each such setting is \ncounted as one element. Optional MIRRORED BITS® and extra I/O board \nSELOGIC settings are also counted as elements, even if not ordered.\n\nAfter SELOGIC control equation settings changes have been made and the \nsettings are saved, the SEL-311C responds with the following message:\n\nxxx Elements and yy Edges remain available\n\nThis indicates that “xxx” Relay Word bits can still be used and “yy” rising- or \nfalling-edge operators can still be applied in the SELOGIC control equations \nfor the particular settings group. \n\nNOTE: If multiple setting groups are \nplanned for the relay settings scheme, \ninspect or test any mission-critical \nSELOGIC settings for desired behavior \nafter a group change.\n\n\n\nF.13\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nSetting SELOGIC Control Equations\nProcessing Order and Processing Interval\n\nProcessing Order and Processing Interval\nThe relay elements and logic (and corresponding SELOGIC control equation \nsettings and resultant Relay Word bits) are processed in the order shown in \nTable F.4 (top to bottom).

Use MIRRORED BITS communications for \nremote control and remote sensing or communications-assisted protection schemes.\n\nThe MIRRORED BITS protocol is available on serial ports 1, 2, 3, or F of \nSEL-311C relays.\n\nSEL products support several variations of MIRRORED BITS communications \nprotocols. Through port settings, you can set the SEL-311C for compatible \noperation with SEL-300 series relays, SEL-400 series relays, SEL-600 series \nrelays, SEL-700 series relays, the SEL-2505 Remote I/O Modules, and the \nSEL-2100 Logic Processors. These devices use MIRRORED BITS \ncommunications to exchange the states of eight logic bits.\n\nSEL Application Guide AG2001-12, Implementing MIRRORED BITS Technology \nOver Various Communications Media, provides an overview of the different types of \ncommunications channels that might be used for MIRRORED BITS.\n\nCommunications Channels and Logical Data Channels\nThe SEL-311C supports two MIRRORED BITS communications channels, \ndesignated A and B. Use the port setting PROTO to assign one of the \nMIRRORED BITS communications channels to a serial port; PROTO = MB8A, \nMBA, or MBGA for MIRRORED BITS communications Channel A or \nPROTO = MB8B, MBB, or MBGB for MIRRORED BITS communications \nChannel B. See Settings for MIRRORED BITS on page H.5.\nTransmitted bits include TMB1A–TMB8A and TMB1B–TMB8B. The last \nletter (A or B) designates the channel with which the bits are associated. \nThese bits are controlled by SELOGIC® control equations. Received bits \ninclude RMB1A–RMB8A and RMB1B–RMB8B. You can use received bits \nas operands in SELOGIC control equations. The channel status bits are ROKA, \nRBADA, CBADA, LBOKA, ROKB, RBADB, CBADB, and LBOKB. You \ncan also use these bits as operands in SELOGIC control equations. Use the \nCOM command for additional channel status information.\n\nWithin each MIRRORED BITS communications message for a given channel \n(A or B), there are eight logical data channels (1–8). Each channel can be used \nto communicate with either channel A or channel B on another relay, or as \nTMB1 through TMB8 if connected to a relay with a single MIRRORED BITS \ncommunications channel, as shown in Figure H.1.\n\n\n\nH.2\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nMIRRORED BITS Communications\nOperation\n\nFigure H.1 Relay-to-Relay Logic Communication\n\nOperation\nMessage \nTransmission\n\nDepending on the settings, the SEL-311C transmits a MIRRORED BITS \ncommunications message every 1/4 to 1/2 of an electrical cycle (see \nTable H.2). Each message contains the most recent values of the transmit bits. \nAll messages are transmitted without idle bits between characters. Idle bits are \nallowed between messages.\n\nMessage Reception When the devices are synchronized and the MIRRORED BITS communications \nchannel is in a normal state, the relay decodes and checks each received \nmessage. If the message is valid, the relay sends each received logic bit \n(RMBnc, where n = 1–8, c = A or B) to the corresponding pickup and dropout \nsecurity counters, that in turn set or clear the RMBnc relay element bits.\n\nMessage Decoding \nand Integrity Checks\n\nThe relay provides indication of the status of each MIRRORED BITS \ncommunications channel, with element bits ROKA and ROKB. During \nnormal operation, the relay sets the ROKc bit. The relay clears the bit upon \ndetecting any of the following conditions:\n\n➤ Parity, framing, or overrun errors.\n\n➤ Receive data redundancy error.\n\n➤ Receive message identification error.\n\n➤ No message received in the time three messages have been sent.\n\nThe relay will assert ROKc only after successful synchronization as described \nbelow and two consecutive messages pass all of the data checks described \nabove. After ROKc is reasserted, received data may be delayed while passing \nthrough the security counters described below.\n\nTransmit\n\nReceive\n\nTransmit\n\nReceive\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nTMB1\n\nTMB2\n\nTMB8\n\nRMB1\n\nRMB2\n\nRMB8 RMB8\n\nTMB1\n\nTMB2\n\nTMB8\n\nRMB1\n\nRMB2\n\nAny SEL relay\nwith MIRRORED BITS\n\nprotocol\n\n. . .\n\n. . . . . .\n\n. . .\nSEL-311C\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\n\nH.3\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nMIRRORED BITS Communications\nOperation\n\nWhile ROKc is not set, the relay does not transfer new RMB data to the \npickup-dropout security counters described below. Instead, the relay sends one \nof the user-definable default values to the security counter inputs. For each bit \nRMB1c–RMB8c, specify the default value with setting RXDFLT, as follows:\n\n➤ 1\n\n➤ 0\n\n➤ X (to use the last valid value)\nPickup/dropout security counters supervise the transfer of received data to \nRMB1c–RMB8c. Set these counters between 1 (allow every occurrence to \npass) and 8 (require eight consecutive occurrences to pass). The pickup and \ndropout security count settings are separate. The bit error rate of the \nMIRRORED BITS communications channel meets IEC-834-1 recommendations \nfor direct tripping when the security counter (debounce) is set to 2 and can be \nfurther improved by increasing the security counter.\n\nA pickup/dropout security counter operates identically to a pickup/dropout \ntimer, except that the counter uses units of “counted received messages,” \ninstead of time. An SEL-311C communicating with another SEL-311C sends \nand receives MIRRORED BITS messages four times per power system cycle. \nTherefore, a security counter set to two counts will delay a bit by about 1/2 \npower system cycle. You must consider the impact of the security counter \nsettings in the receiving device to determine the channel timing performance.\n\nThings become slightly more complicated when two relays of different \nprocessing rates are connected via MIRRORED BITS (for instance, an SEL-321 \ntalking to an SEL-311C). The SEL-321 processes power system information \neach 1/8 power system cycle but processes the pickup/dropout security \ncounters as messages are received. Because the SEL-321 is receiving \nmessages from the SEL-311C, it will receive a message each 1/4 cycle \nprocessing interval. So, a counter set to two will again delay a bit by about 1/2 \ncycle. However, in that same example, a security counter set to two on the \nSEL-311C will delay a bit by 1/4 cycle, because the SEL-311C is receiving \nnew MIRRORED BITS messages each 1/8 cycle from the SEL-321.\n\nChannel \nSynchronization\n\nWhen an SEL-311C detects a communications error, it deasserts ROKc. If a \nnode detects two consecutive communications errors, it transmits an attention \nmessage, which includes its TXID setting.\n\nWhen a node receives an attention message, it checks to see if its TXID is included.\n\nIf its own TXID is included and at least one other TXID is included, the node \ntransmits data.\n\nIf its own TXID is not included, the node deasserts ROKc, includes its TXID \nin the attention message, and transmits the new attention message.\n\nIf its own TXID is the only TXID included, the relay assumes the message is \ncorrupted unless the loopback mode has been enabled. If loopback is not \nenabled, the node deasserts ROKc and transmits the attention message with its \nTXID included. If loopback is enabled, the relay transmits data.\n\nIn summary, when a node detects two consecutive errors, it transmits attention \nuntil it receives an attention with its own TXID included. If three or four \nrelays are connected in a ring topology, then the attention message will go all \nthe way around the loop, and eventually will be received by the originating \nnode. It will then be killed and data transmission will resume. This method of \nsynchronization allows the relays to determine reliably which byte is the first \nbyte of the message. It also forces mis-synchronized UARTs to become re-\n\n\n\nH.4\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nMIRRORED BITS Communications\nMIRRORED BITS Protocol for the Pulsar 9600 Baud Modem\n\nsynchronized. Unfortunately, this method temporarily defeats \ncommunications over the entire loop for a receive error at any node in the \nloop. This decreases availability and also makes one-way communications \nimpossible.\n\nLoopback Testing Use the LOO (loopback) command to enable loopback testing. While in \nloopback mode, ROKc is deasserted, and LBOKc asserts and deasserts based \non the received data checks. See LOO Command (Loop Back) on page 10.50 \nfor full details on the LOO command.\n\nChannel Monitoring Based on the results of data checks described above, the relay will collect \ninformation regarding the 255 most recent communications errors. Each \nrecord contains at least the following fields:\n\n➤ Dropout Time/Date\n\n➤ Pickup Time/Date\n\n➤ Time elapsed during dropout\n\n➤ Reason for dropout (see Message Decoding and Integrity \nChecks on page H.2)\n\nUse the COM command to generate a long or summary report of the \ncommunications errors.\n\nThere is a single record for each outage, but an outage can evolve. For example, the \ninitial cause could be a data disagreement, but framing errors can extend the outage. \nIf the channel is presently down, the COM record will only show the initial cause, \nbut the COM summary will display the present cause of failure.\n\nWhen the duration of an outage on Channel A or B exceeds a user-definable \nthreshold, the relay will assert a user-accessible flag, RBADc.\n\nWhen channel unavailability exceeds a user-settable threshold, the relay will \nassert a user accessible flag, hereafter called CBADc.\n\nSee COM Command (Communications Data) on page 10.39 for full details on \nthe COM command, including sample reports.\n\nMIRRORED BITS Protocol for the Pulsar 9600 Baud Modem\nSetting RTSCTS = MBT indicates that a Pulsar MBT modem is connected. \nWhen the user selects MBT, the baud rate setting must be set to 9600 baud.\n\nThe MIRRORED BITS protocol compatible with the Pulsar MBT-9600 modem is \nidentical to the standard MIRRORED BITS protocol with the following exceptions:\n\n➤ The relay injects a delay (idle time) between messages.\n➤ The length of the delay is one relay processing interval.\n\n➤ The relay resets RTS (to a negative voltage at the EIA-232 \nconnector).\n\nNOTE: The MBT mode will not work \nwith PROTO = MB8A, MB8B, MBGA, or \nMBGB.\n\n\n\nH.5\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nMIRRORED BITS Communications\nSettings for MIRRORED BITS\n\n➤ The relay resets RTS (to a negative voltage at the EIA-232 \nconnector).\nThe relay sets RTS (to a positive voltage at the EIA-232 \nconnector) for MIRRORED BITS communications that use the \nR6 or original R version of MIRRORED BITS.\n\n➤ The relay monitors the CTS signal on the EIA-232 connector, which \nthe modem will deassert if the channel has too many errors.\n\nSettings for MIRRORED BITS\nThe SEL-311C port settings associated with MIRRORED BITS communications are shown in Table H.1. \n\nFor convenience, MIRRORED BITS settings are included in the settings sheets.

These selections are provided for compatibility with existing \nequipment.\n\nThe MB8A, MB8B, MBGA, and MBGB protocols use an 8-data bit format, \nwhich allows MIRRORED BITS to operate on communication channels \nrequiring an 8-data bit format. These selections are compatible with more \nequipment types and are recommended for new installations.\n\nProtocols MBGA and MBGB move RXID and TXID settings from Port \nsettings to Group settings. This allows TXID and RXID to be unique per \nsettings group. See Application Guide AG2005-09, Using the SEL-2126 \nFiber-Optic Transfer Switch and the SEL-321-1 in Bypass-Breaker MIRRORED \nBITS Communications-Assisted Tripping Schemes.\n\nAs a function of the settings for SPEED, the message transmission periods are \nshown in Table H.2.\n\nSet the RXID of the local relay to match the TXID of the remote relay. For \nexample, for a two-terminal application, where Relay X transmits to Relay Y \nand Relay Y transmits to Relay X:\n\nSee SEL Application Guide AG96-17, Three-Terminal Line Protection Using \nSEL-321-1 Relays With MIRRORED BITS Communications, for details on three-\nterminal applications.\n\nUse the RBADPU setting to determine how long a channel error must last \nbefore the relay element RBADA is asserted. RBADA is deasserted when the \nchannel error is corrected. RBADPU is accurate to ±1 second.\n\nUse the CBADPU setting to determine the ratio of channel down time to the \ntotal channel time before the relay element CBADc is asserted. The times used \nin the calculation are those that are available in the COM records. See the \nCOM Command (Communications Data) on page 10.39 for a description of \nthe COM records.\n\nTable H.2 Message Transmission Periods\n\nSPEED SEL-311C\n\n57600 1 message per 1/4 cycle\n\n38400 1 message per 1/4 cycle\n\n19200 1 message per 1/4 cycle\n\n9600 1 message per 1/4 cycle\n\n4800 1 message per 1/2 cycle\n\nTXID RXID\n\nRelay X 1 2\n\nRelay Y 2 1\n\n\n\nH.7\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nMIRRORED BITS Communications\nSettings for MIRRORED BITS\n\nUse the RXDFLT setting to determine the default state the MIRRORED BITS \nshould use in place of received data if an error condition is detected.

It is appropriate for low-cost, low-\nspeed port switching applications where updating a real-time database is not a \nrequirement.\n\nLMD is often used with EIA-485 serial communications. In the SEL-311C the \nPROTO = LMD setting choice is allowed on any serial port, even on relays \nwithout the optional EIA-485 port.\n\nSettings\nUse the front-panel SET pushbutton or the serial port SET P command to \nactivate the LMD protocol. Change the port PROTO setting from the default \nSEL to LMD to reveal the following LMD-specific settings:\n\nSee SEL LMD Protocol Settings on page SET.42 for the full list of settings, \nincluding the port time-out setting.\n\nSettings Description\n\nPREFIX: One character to precede the address. This should be a character that does \nnot occur in the course of other communications with the relay. Valid \nchoices are one of the following: “@”, “#”, “$”, “%”, “&”. The default is \n“@.”\n\nADDR: Two-character ASCII address. The range is “01” to “99.” The default is \n“01.”\n\nSETTLE: Time in seconds that transmission is delayed after the request to send (RTS \nline) asserts. This delay accommodates transmitters with a slow rise time.\n\n\n\nI.2\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nSEL Distributed Port Switch Protocol\nOperation\n\nOperation\n1. The relay ignores all input from this port until it detects the \n\nprefix character and the two-byte address.\n\n2. Upon receipt of the prefix and address, the relay enables echo \nand message transmission.\n\n3. Wait until you receive a prompt before entering commands to \navoid losing echoed characters while the external transmitter is \nwarming up.\n\n4. Until the relay connection terminates, you can use the standard \ncommands that are available when PROTO is set to SEL.\n\n5. The QUIT command terminates the connection. If no data are \nsent to the relay before the port time-out period, it \nautomatically terminates the connection.\n\n6. Enter the sequence <Ctrl+X> QUIT <CR> before entering the \nprefix character if all relays in the multidrop network do not \nhave the same prefix setting.\n\nNOTE: You can use the front-panel \nSET pushbutton, or another \ncommunications port, to change the \nLMD port settings to return to SEL \nprotocol.\n\n\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nAppendix J\nR.Instruction Manual\n\nConfiguration, Fast Meter, \nand Fast Operate Commands\n\nOverview\nSEL relays have two separate data streams that share the same serial port. \nData communications with the relay consist of ASCII character commands \nand reports that are intelligible using a terminal or terminal emulation \npackage. The binary data streams can interrupt the ASCII data stream to \nobtain information and then allow the ASCII data stream to continue.\n\nThis mechanism allows a single communications channel to be used for ASCII \ncommunications (e.g., transmission of a long event report) interleaved with short \nbursts of binary data to support fast acquisition of metering data. The device \nconnected to the other end of the link requires software that uses the separate data \nstreams to exploit this feature. The binary commands and ASCII commands can \nalso be accessed by a device that does not interleave the data streams.\n\nSEL Application Guide AG95-10, Configuration and Fast Meter Messages, is \na comprehensive description of the SEL binary messages.

Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nConfiguration, Fast Meter, and Fast Operate Commands\nMessage Definitions\n\nA5E0 Fast Operate \nRemote Bit Control\n\nThe external device sends the following message to perform a remote bit \noperation.\n\nThe relay performs the specified remote bit operation if the following \nconditions are true:\n\n➤ The Operate code is valid.\n\n➤ The Operate validation = 4 • Operate code + 1.\n\n➤ The message checksum is valid.\n\n➤ The FASTOP port setting is set to Y.\n\n➤ The relay is enabled.\n\nRemote bit set and clear operations are latched by the relay. Remote bit pulse \noperations assert the remote bit for one processing interval (1/4 cycle).\nIt is common practice to route remote bits to output contacts to provide remote \ncontrol of the relay outputs. If you wish to pulse an output contact closed for a \nspecific duration, SEL recommends using the remote bit pulse command and \nSELOGIC® control equations to provide secure and accurate contact control. \nThe remote device sends the remote bit pulse command; the relay controls the \ntiming of the output contact assertion. You can use any remote bit\n(RB1–RB32), and any SELOGIC control equation timer (SV1–SV16) to \ncontrol any of the output contacts. For example, to pulse output contact OUT104 \nfor 30 cycles with Remote Bit RB4 and SELOGIC control equation timer SV4, \nissue the following relay settings:\n\nVia the SET command:\nESV = 4 enable 4 SELOGIC control equations\nSV4PU = 0 SV4 pickup time = 0\nSV4DO = 30 SV4 dropout time is 30 cycles\n\nVia the SET L command:\nSV4 = RB4 SV4 input is RB4\nOUT104 = SV4T route SV4 timer output to OUT104\n\nTo pulse the contact, send the A5E006430DDB command to the relay.\n\nTable J.9 A5E0 Fast Operate Remote Bit Control\n\nData Description\n\nA5E0 Command\n\n06 Length\n\n1 byte Operate code:\n00–1F clear remote bit RB1–RB32\n20–3F set remote bit RB1–RB32\n40–5F pulse remote bit for RB1–RB32 for one processing \ninterval\n\n1 byte Operate validation: 4 • Operate code + 1\n\nxx 1-byte checksum of preceding bytes\n\n\n\nJ.12\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nConfiguration, Fast Meter, and Fast Operate Commands\nMessage Definitions\n\nA5E3 Fast Operate \nBreaker Control\n\nThe external device sends the following message to perform a fast breaker \nopen/close.\n\nThe relay performs the specified breaker operation if the following conditions \nare true:\n\n➤ Conditions 1–5 defined in the A5E0 message are true.\n\n➤ The breaker jumper (JMP1B) is in place on the SEL-311C \nmain board.\n\nA5CD Fast Operate \nReset Definition \nBlock\n\nIn response to an A5CD request, the relay sends the configuration block for \nthe Fast Operate Reset message.\n\nA5ED Fast Operate \nReset Command\n\nThe Fast Operate Reset commands take the following form.\n\nID Message In response to the ID command, the relay sends the firmware ID (FID), boot \nfirmware ID (BFID), firmware checksum (CID), relay TID setting (DEVID), \nModbus® device code (DEVCODE)—for use by an SEL communications \nprocessor, relay part number (PARTNO), relay serial number (SERIALNO), \nand configuration string (CONFIG)—for use by other IEDs or software.\n\nTable J.10 A5E3 Fast Operate Breaker Control\n\nData Description\n\nA5E3 Command\n\n06 Length\n\nl byte Operate code:\n31—OPEN breaker\n11—CLOSE breaker\n\n1 byte Operate Validation: 4 • Operate code + 1\n\nxx 1-byte checksum of preceding bytes\n\nTable J.11 A5CD Fast Operate Reset Definition Block\n\nData Description\n\nA5CD Command\n\n0E Message length\n\n01 The number of Fast Operate reset codes supported\n\n00 Reserved for future use\n\n00 Fast Operate reset code (“00” for target reset)\n54415220520D00 Fast Operate reset description string (“TAR R”)\nxx 1-byte checksum of preceding bytes\n\nTable J.12 A5ED Fast Operate Reset Command\n\nData Description\n\nA5ED Command\n\n06 Message Length—always 6\n\n00 Operate Code (“00” for target reset, “TAR R”)\n01 Operate Validation—(4 • Operate Code) + 1\nxx 1-byte checksum of preceding bytes\n\n\n\nJ.13\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nConfiguration, Fast Meter, and Fast Operate Commands\nMessage Definitions\n\nA sample response is shown below; responses will differ depending on relay \nmodel, settings, and firmware.\n\n<STX>\n\"FID=SEL-311C-2-R5xx-V0-Zxxxxxx-Dxxxxxxxx\",\"yyyy\"<CR><LF>\n\"BFID=SLBT-3CF1-Rxxx-V0-Zxxxxxx-Dxxxxxxxx\",\"yyyy\"<CR><LF>\n\"CID=xxxx\",\"yyyy\"<CR><LF>\n\"DEVID=STATION A\",\"yyyy\"<CR><LF>\n\"DEVCODE=51\",\"yyyy\"<CR><LF>\n\"PARTNO=0311C21HR3F54C2\",\"yyyy\"<CR><LF>\n“SERIALNO=2011001001”,”05EF”\n\"CONFIG=11222201\",\"yyyy\"<CR><LF>\n\"SPECIAL=11000\",\"yyyy\"<CR><LF>\n\"iedName=\",\"yyyy\"<CR><LF>\n\"type=\",\"yyyy\"<CR><LF>\n\"configVersion=\",\"yyyy\"<CR><LF>\n<ETX>\n\nThe ID message is available from Access Level 0 and higher.\n\nDNA Message In response to the DNA T or DNA X command, the relay sends names of the \nRelay Word bits transmitted in the A5D1 message.

DNP3 is \none of the protocols included in the IEEE® 1379-7000, Recommended \nPractice for Data Communication between Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) \nand Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) in a Substation.\nThe DNP Users Group maintains and publishes DNP3 standards. See the DNP \nUsers Group website, www.dnp.org, for more information on standards, \nimplementers, and tools for working with DNP3.\n\nDNP3 Specifications DNP3 is a feature-rich protocol with many ways to accomplish tasks, defined \nin an eight-volume series of specifications. Volume 8 of the specification, \ncalled the Interoperability Specification, simplifies DNP3 implementation by \nproviding four standard interoperable implementation levels. The levels are \nlisted in Table L.1.\n\nTable L.1 DNP3 Implementation Levels \n\nLevel Description Equipment Types\n\n1 Simple: limited communication requirements Meters, simple IEDs\n2 Moderately complex: monitoring and metering \n\ndevices and multifunction devices that contain \nmore data\n\nProtective relays, RTUs\n\n3 Sophisticated: devices with great amounts of data \nor complex communication requirements\n\nLarge RTUs, SCADA \nmasters\n\n4 Enhanced: additional data types and functionality \nfor more complex requirements\n\nLarge RTUs, SCADA \nmasters\n\n\n\nL.2\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nDNP3 Communications\nIntroduction to DNP3\n\nEach level is a proper superset of the previous lower-numbered level. A \nhigher-level device can act as a master to a lower-level device, but can only \nuse the data types and functions implemented in the lower level device. For \nexample, a typical SCADA master is a Level 3 device and can use Level 2 (or \nlower) functions to poll a Level 2 (or lower) device for Level 2 (or lower) data. \nSimilarly, a lower-level device can poll a higher-level device, but the lower \nlevel device can only access the features and data available to its level.\n\nIn addition to the eight-volume DNP3 specification, the protocol is further \nrefined by conformance requirements, optional features, and a series of \ntechnical bulletins. The technical bulletins supplement the specifications with \ndiscussion and examples of specific features of DNP3.\n\nData Handling\nObjects\n\nDNP3 uses a system of data references called objects, defined by Volume 6 of \nthe DNP3 specification. Each subset level specification requires a minimum \nimplementation of object types and recommends several optional object types. \nDNP3 object types, commonly referred to as objects, are specifications for the \ntype of data the object carries. An object can include a single value or more \ncomplex data. Some objects serve as shorthand references for special \noperations, including collections of data, time synchronization, or even all \ndata within the DNP3 device.\n\nEach instance of the object includes an index that makes it unique. For \nexample, each binary status point (Object 1) has an index. If there are 16 \nbinary status points, these points are Object 1, Index 0 through Object 1, \nIndex 15.\n\nEach object also includes multiple versions called variations. For example, \nObject 1 (binary inputs) has three variations: 0, 1, and 2. You can use variation \n0 to request the default variation, variation 1 to specify binary input values \nonly, and variation 2 to specify binary input values with status information. \n\nEach DNP3 device has both a list of objects and a map of object indices. The \nlist of objects defines the available objects, variations, and qualifier codes. The \nmap defines the indices for objects that have multiple instances and defines \nwhat data or control points correspond with each index.\n\nA master initiates all DNP3 message exchanges except unsolicited data. \nDNP3 terminology describes all points from the perspective of the master. \nBinary points for control that move from the master to the outstation are called \nBinary Outputs, while binary status points within the outstation are called \nBinary Inputs.\n\nFunction Codes\nEach DNP3 message includes a function code. Each object has a limited set of \nfunction codes that a master may use to manipulate the object. The object \nlisting for the device shows the permitted function codes for each type of \nobject. The most common DNP3 function codes are listed in Table L.2.\n\n\n\nL.3\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nDNP3 Communications\nIntroduction to DNP3\n\nQualifier Codes and Ranges\nDNP3 masters use qualifier codes and ranges to make requests for specific \nobjects by index. Qualifier codes specify the style of range, and the range \nspecifies the indices of the objects of interest. DNP3 masters use qualifier \ncodes to compose the shortest, most concise message possible when \nrequesting points from a DNP3 outstation.\n\nFor example, the qualifier code 01 specifies that the request for points will \ninclude a start address and a stop address. Each of these two addresses uses \ntwo bytes. An example request using qualifier code 01 might have the four \nhexadecimal byte range field, 00h 04h 00h 10h, which specifies points in the \nrange 4 to 16.\n\nAccess Methods DNP3 has many features that help obtain maximum possible message \nefficiency. DNP3 masters send requests with the least number of bytes using \nspecial objects, variations, and qualifiers that reduce the message size. Other \nfeatures eliminate the continual exchange of static (unchanging) data values. \nThese features optimize use of bandwidth and maximize performance over a \nconnection of any speed.\n\nDNP3 event data collection eliminates the need to use bandwidth to transmit \nvalues that have not changed. Event data are time-stamped records that show \nwhen observed measurements changed. For binary points, the remote device \n(DNP3 outstation) logs changes from logical 1 to logical 0 and from logical 0 \nto logical 1. For analog points, the outstation device logs changes that exceed \na dead band. DNP3 outstation devices collect event data in a buffer that either \nthe master can request or the device can send to the master without a request \nmessage. Data sent from the outstation to the master without a polling request \nare called unsolicited data.\n\nDNP3 data fit into one of four event classes: 0, 1, 2, or 3. Class 0 is reserved \nfor reading the present value (static) data. Classes 1, 2, and 3 are event data \nclasses. The meaning of Classes 1 to 3 is arbitrary and defined by the \napplication at hand. With outstations that contain great amounts of data or in \nlarge systems, the three event classes provide a framework for prioritizing \ndifferent types of data. For example, you can poll once a minute for Class 1 \ndata, once an hour for Class 2 data, and once a day for Class 3 data.\n\nDNP3 also supports static polling: simple polling of the present value of data \npoints within the outstation. By combining event data, unsolicited polling, and \nstatic polling, you can operate your system in one of the four access methods \nshown in Table L.3.\n\nThe access methods listed in Table L.3 are listed in order of increasing \ncommunication efficiency. With various tradeoffs, each method is less \ndemanding of communication bandwidth than the previous one. For example, \nunsolicited report-by-exception consumes less communication bandwidth \n\nTable L.2 Selected DNP3 Function Codes \n\nFunction \nCode\n\nFunction Description\n\n1 Read Request data from the outstation\n2 Write Send data to the outstation\n3 Select First part of a select-before-operate operation\n4 Operate Second part of a select-before-operate operation\n5 Direct operate One-step operation with reply\n6 Direct operate, no reply One-step operation with no reply\n\n\n\nL.4\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nDNP3 Communications\nIntroduction to DNP3\n\nthan polled report-by-exception because that method does not require polling \nmessages from the master. In order to properly evaluate which access method \nprovides optimum performance for your application, you should also consider \noverall system size and the volume of data communication expected.\n\nBinary Control \nOperations\n\nDNP3 masters use Object 12, control device output block, to perform DNP3 \nbinary control operations. The control device output block has both a trip/\nclose selection and a code selection. The trip/close selection allows a single \nDNP3 index to operate two related control points such as trip and close or \nraise and lower. Trip/close pair operation is not recommended for new DNP3 \ndevices, but is often included for interoperability with older DNP3 master \nimplementations.\n\nThe control device output block code selection specifies either a latch or pulse \noperation on the point. In many cases, DNP3 outstations have only a limited \nsubset of the possible combinations of the code field. Sometimes, DNP3 \noutstations assign special operation characteristics to the latch and pulse \nselections. \n\nConformance Testing In addition to the protocol specifications, the DNP Users Group has approved \nconformance-testing requirements for Level 1 and Level 2 devices. Some \nimplementers perform their own conformance specification testing, while \nsome contract with independent companies to perform conformance testing.\n\nConformance testing does not always guarantee that a master and outstation \nwill be fully interoperable (that is, work together properly for all implemented \nfeatures). Conformance testing does help to standardize the testing procedure \nand move the DNP3 implementers toward a higher level of interoperability.\n\nDNP3 Serial Network Issues\nData Link Layer Operation\n\nDNP3 employs a three-layer version of the seven-layer OSI (Open Systems \nInterconnect) model called the enhanced performance architecture. The layer \ndefinition helps to categorize functions and duties of various software \ncomponents that make up the protocol. The middle layer, the Data Link Layer, \nincludes several functions for error checking and media access control.\n\nA feature called data link confirmation is a mechanism that provides positive \nconfirmation of message receipt by the receiving DNP3 device. While this \nfeature helps you recognize a failed device or failed communications link \nquickly, it also adds significant overhead to the DNP3 conversation. You \nshould consider whether you require this link integrity function in your \napplication at the expense of overall system speed and performance.\n\nTable L.3 DNP3 Access Methods\n\nAccess Method Description\n\nPolled static Master polls for present value (Class 0) data only\nPolled report-by-exception Master polls frequently for event data and occasionally \n\nfor Class 0 data\nUnsolicited report-by-excep-\ntion\n\nOutstation devices send unsolicited event data to the \nmaster, and the master occasionally polls for Class 0 data\n\nQuiescent Master never polls and relies on unsolicited reports only\n\n\n\nL.5\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nDNP3 Communications\nIntroduction to DNP3\n\nThe DNP3 technical bulletin (DNP Confirmation and Retry Guidelines 9804-\n002) on confirmation processes recommends against using data link \nconfirmations because these processes can add to traffic in situations where \ncommunications are marginal. The increased traffic will reduce connection \nthroughput further, possibly preventing the system from operating properly.\n\nNetwork Medium Contention\nWhen more than one device requires access to a single (serial) network \nmedium, you should provide a mechanism to resolve the resulting network \nmedium contention. For example, unsolicited reporting results in network \nmedium contention if you do not design your serial network as a star topology \nof point-to point connections or use carrier detection on a multidrop network.\n\nTo avoid collisions among devices trying to send messages, DNP3 includes a \ncollision avoidance feature. Before sending a message, a DNP3 device listens \nfor a carrier signal to verify that no other node is transmitting data. The device \ntransmits if there is no carrier or waits for a random time before transmitting. \nHowever, if two nodes both detect a lack of carrier at the same instant, these \ntwo nodes could begin simultaneous transmission of data and cause a data \ncollision. If your serial network allows for spontaneous data transmission \nincluding unsolicited event data transmissions, you also should use \napplication confirmation to provide a retry mechanism for messages lost due \nto data collisions.\n\nDNP3 LAN/WAN \nOverview\n\nThe main process for carrying DNP3 over an Ethernet Network (LAN/WAN) \ninvolves encapsulating the DNP3 data link layer data frames within the \ntransport layer frames of the Internet Protocol (IP) suite. This allows the IP \nstack to deliver the DNP3 data link layer frames to the destination in place of \nthe original DNP3 physical layer.\n\nThe DNP User Group Technical Committee has recommended the following \nguidelines for carrying DNP3 over a network:\n\n➤ DNP3 shall use the IP suite to transport messages over a LAN/\nWAN\n\n➤ Ethernet is the recommended physical link, though others may \nbe used\n\n➤ TCP must be used for WANs\n\n➤ TCP is strongly recommended for LANs\n\n➤ User Datagram Protocol (UDP) may be used for highly reliable \nsingle segment LANs\n\n➤ UDP is necessary if broadcast messages are required\n\n➤ The DNP3 protocol stack shall be retained in full\n\n➤ Link layer confirmations shall be disabled\n\nThe Technical Committee has registered a standard port number, 20000, for \nDNP3 with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). This port is \nused for either TCP or UDP.\n\nNOTE: Link layer confirmations are \nexplicitly disabled for DNP3 LAN/\nWAN. The IP suite already provides a \nreliable delivery mechanism, which is \nbacked up at the application layer by \nconfirmations when required.\n\n\n\nL.6\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nDNP3 Communications\nDNP3 in the SEL-311C\n\nTCP/UDP Selection\nThe Committee recommends the selection of TCP or UDP protocol as per the \nguidelines in Table L.4.\n\nDNP3 in the SEL-311C\nThe SEL-311C is a DNP3 Level 2 remote (outstation) device. \n\nData Access Table L.5 lists DNP3 data access methods along with corresponding \nSEL-311C settings. You must select a data access method and configure each \nDNP3 master for polling as specified.\n\nIn both the unsolicited report-by-exception and quiescent polling methods \nshown in Table L.5, you must make a selection for the PUNSOLn setting. This \nsetting enables or disables unsolicited data reporting at power up. If your \nDNP3 master can send a message to enable unsolicited reporting on the \nSEL-311C, you should set PUNSOLn to No.\n\nWhile automatic unsolicited data transmission on power up is convenient, this \ncan cause problems if your DNP3 master is not prepared to start receiving data \nimmediately on power up. If the master does not acknowledge the unsolicited \ndata with an Application Confirm, the device will resend the data until it is \nacknowledged. On a large system, or in systems where the processing power \nof the master is limited, you may have problems when several devices \nsimultaneously begin sending data and waiting for acknowledgment \nmessages.\n\nTable L.4 TCP/UDP Selection Guidelines\n\nUse in the case of… TCP UDP\n\nMost situations X\nNon-broadcast or multicast X\nMesh Topology WAN X\nBroadcast X\nMulticast X\nHigh-reliability single-segment LAN X\nPay-per-byte, nonmesh WAN, for example, Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) X\nLow priority data, for example, data monitor or configuration information X\n\nTable L.5 DNP3 Access Methods \n\nAccess Method Master Polling SEL-311C Settings\n\nPolled static Class 0 Set ECLASSBn, ECLASSCn, \nECLASSAn to 0; UNSOLn to N.\n\nPolled report-by-\nexception\n\nClass 0 occasionally, Class 1, \n2, 3 frequently\n\nSet ECLASSBn, ECLASSCn, \nECLASSAn to the desired event \nclass; UNSOLn to N.\n\nUnsolicited report-\nby-exception\n\nClass 0 occasionally, \noptional Class 1, 2, 3 less \nfrequently; mainly relies on \nunsolicited messages\n\nSet ECLASSBn, ECLASSCn, \nECLASSAn to the desired event \nclass; set UNSOLn to Y and \nPUNSOLn to Y or N.\n\nQuiescent Class 0, 1, 2, 3 never; relies \ncompletely on unsolicited \nmessages\n\nSet ECLASSBn, ECLASSCn, \nECLASSAn to the desired event \nclass; set UNSOLn and PUNSOLn \nto Y.\n\nNOTE: Because unsolicited \nmessaging is problematic in most \ncircumstances, SEL recommends \nusing the polled report-by-exception \naccess method to maximize \nperformance and minimize risk of \nconfiguration problems. \n\nNOTE: In the settings below, the \nsuffix n represents the DNP3 LAN/\nWAN session number from 1 to 6. This \nsuffix is not present in Serial Port \nDNP3 settings. All settings with the \nsame numerical suffix comprise the \ncomplete DNP3 session configuration.\n\n\n\nL.7\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nDNP3 Communications\nDNP3 in the SEL-311C\n\nIf the SEL-311C does not receive an Application Confirm in response to \nunsolicited data, it will wait for ETIMEOn seconds and then repeat the \nunsolicited message. In order to prevent clogging of the network with \nunsolicited data retries, the SEL-311C uses the URETRYn and UTIMEOn \nsettings to increase retry time when the number of retries set in URETRYn is \nexceeded. After URETRYn has been exceeded, the SEL-311C pauses \nUTIMEOn seconds and then transmits the unsolicited data again. Figure L.1 \nprovides an example with URETRYn = 2.\n\nFigure L.1 Application Confirmation Timing With URETRYn = 2\n\nCollision Avoidance If your application uses unsolicited reporting on a serial network, you must \nselect a half-duplex medium or a medium that includes carrier detection to \navoid data collisions. EIA-485 two-wire networks are half-duplex. EIA-485 \nfour-wire networks do not provide carrier detection, while EIA-232 systems \ncan support carrier detection. DNP3 LAN/WAN uses features of the IP suite \nfor collision avoidance, so does not require these settings.\n\nNOTE: MINDLY and MAXDLY settings \nare only available for EIA-232 and \nEIA-485 serial port sessions.\n\nThe SEL-311C uses Application Confirmation messages to guarantee delivery \nof unsolicited event data before erasing the local event data buffer. Data \ncollisions are typically resolved when messages are repeated until confirmed.\n\nThe SEL-311C pauses for a random delay between the settings MAXDLY and \nMINDLY when it detects a carrier through data on the receive line or the CTS \npin. For example, if you use the settings of 0.10 seconds for MAXDLY and \n0.05 seconds for MINDLY, the SEL-311C will insert a random delay of 50 to \n100 ms (milliseconds) between the end of carrier detection and the start of \ndata transmission (see Figure L.2).\n\nFigure L.2 Message Transmission Timing\n\nTransmission Control If you use a media transceiver (for example, EIA-232 to EIA-485) or a radio \nsystem for your DNP3 network, you may need to adjust data transmission \nproperties. Use the PREDLY and POSTDLY settings to provide a delay \nbetween RTS signal control and data transmission (see Figure L.2). For \nexample, an EIA-485 transceiver typically requires 10 to 20 ms to change \nfrom receive to transmit. If you set the predelay to 30 ms, you will avoid data \nloss resulting from data transmission beginning at the same time as RTS signal \nassertion.\n\nRX DATA\n(Event Data Confirmation)\n\nTX DATA\n\nETIMEOn\n\nRetry #2Retry #1\n\nConfirmation\n\nETIMEOn\n\nUTIMEOnETIMEOn\n\nRetry #2Retry #1\n\nUTIMEOn\n\nReceipt of RX \nDATA or CTS\n\nRandom Delay\nMINDLY to MAXDLY\n\nRTS\n\nTX DATA\nPREDLY PSTDLY\n\nNOTE: PREDLY and POSTDLY \nsettings are only available for EIA-232 \nand EIA-485 serial port sessions.\n\n\n\nL.8\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nDNP3 Communications\nDNP3 in the SEL-311C\n\nEvent Data DNP3 event data objects contain change-of-state and time-stamp information \nthat the SEL-311C collects and stores in a buffer. Points assigned in the \nBinary Input Map that are also assigned in the Sequential Events Recorder \n(SER) settings carry the time stamp of actual occurrence. Binary input points \nnot assigned in the SER settings will carry a time stamp based on the DNP \nmap scan time. This may be significantly delayed from when the original \nsource changed and should not be used for sequence-of-events determination. \nThe DNP map is scanned approximately once per second to generate events. \nYou can configure the SEL-311C to either report the data without a polling \nrequest from the master (unsolicited data) or hold the data until the master \nrequests it with an event poll message.\n\nWith the event class settings ECLASSBn, ECLASSCn, and ECLASSAn, you \ncan set the event class for binary, counter, and analog inputs for Ethernet port \nsession n (the suffix n is not present for serial port event class settings). You \ncan use the classes as a simple priority system for collecting event data. The \nSEL-311C does not treat data of different classes differently with respect to \nmessage scanning, but it does allow the master to perform independent class \npolls.\n\nFor event data collection you must also consider and enter appropriate settings \nfor dead-band and scaling operation on analog points shown in Table L.10. \nYou can either:\n\n➤ set and use default dead band and scaling according to data \ntype, or \n\n➤ use a custom data map to select dead bands on a point-by-point \nbasis.\n\nDead bands for analog inputs can be modified at run-time by writing to Object \n34. Dead-band changes via Object 34 are stored in volatile memory. Make \nsure to reissue the Object 34 dead-band changes you wish to retain after a \nchange to DNP port settings, issuing a STA C command, or a relay cold-start \n(power-cycle).\nThe settings ANADBAn, ANADBVn, and ANADBMn control default dead-\nband operation for each type of analog data. Because DNP3 Objects 30 and 32 \nuse integer data by default, you may have to use scaling to send digits after the \ndecimal point and avoid rounding to a simple integer value.\n\nYou can set the default analog value class level scaling with the DECPLAn, \nDECPLVn, and DECPLMn settings. Application of event reporting dead \nbands occurs after scaling. For example, if you set DECPLAn to 2 and \nANADBAn to 10, a measured current of 10.14 amps would be scaled to the \nvalue 1014 and would have to increase to more than 1024 or decrease to less \nthan 1004 (a change in magnitude of ± 0.1 amps) for the device to report a \nnew event value.\n\nWith no scaling and transmitting with the default variation, the value of \n12.632 would be truncated and sent as 13. With a class level scaling setting of \n1, the value transmitted is 126. With a class level scaling setting of 3, the value \ntransmitted is 12632. You must make certain that the maximum value does not \nexceed 32767 if you are polling the default 16-bit variations for Objects 30 \nand 32, but you can send some decimal values using this technique. You must \nalso configure the master to perform the appropriate division on the incoming \nvalue to display it properly.\n\nThe SEL-311C uses the NUM1EVEn and AGE1EVEn settings to decide \nwhen to send unsolicited data to the master. The device sends an unsolicited \nreport when the total number of events accumulated in the event buffer for \n\nNOTE: Time stamps reported in the \nSER are truncated to the nearest \nmillisecond while time stamps \nreported through DNP are rounded to \nthe nearest millisecond. As a result, \nthe time stamps reported in each \ninterface may occasionally be \ndifferent by 1 ms.\n\nNOTE: Most RTUs that act as \nsubstation DNP3 masters perform an \nevent poll that collects event data of \nall classes simultaneously. You must \nconfirm that the polling configuration \nof your master allows independent \npolling for each class before \nimplementing separate classes in the \nSEL-311C.\n\n\n\nL.9\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nDNP3 Communications\nDNP3 in the SEL-311C\n\nmaster n reaches NUM1EVEn. The device also sends an unsolicited report if \nthe age of the oldest event in the master n buffer exceeds AGE1EVEn. The \nSEL-311C has the per-session buffer capacities listed in Table L.6.\n\nBinary Controls The SEL-311C provides more than one way to control individual points. The \nSEL-311C maps incoming control points either to remote bits or to internal \ncommand bits that cause circuit breaker operations. \n\nA DNP3 technical bulletin (Control Relay Output Block Minimum \nImplementation 9701-002) recommends that you use one point per Object 12, \ncontrol block output device. You can use this method to perform Pulse On, \nPulse Off, Latch On, and Latch Off operations on selected remote bits.\n\nIf your master does not support the single-point-per-index messages or single \noperation database points, you can use the trip/close operation or use the code \nfield in the DNP3 message to specify operation of the points.\n\nTime Synchronization The accuracy of DNP3 time synchronization is insufficient for most protection \nand oscillography needs. DNP3 time synchronization provides backup time \nsynchronization in the event the device loses primary synchronization through \nthe IRIG-B input or the Simple Network Time protocol (SNTP). You can \nenable time synchronization with the TIMERQn setting and then use Object \n50, Variation 1, and Object 52, Variation 2, to set the time via the Session n \nDNP3 master (Object 50, variation 3 for DNP3 LAN/WAN).\nBy default, the SEL-311C accepts but does not act on time set requests \n(TIMERQn = I for “ignore”). This mode allows the SEL-311C to use a high \naccuracy, IRIG time source, but still interoperate with DNP3 masters that send \ntime synchronization messages. It can be set to request time synchronization \nperiodically by setting the TIMERQn setting to the desired period. It can also \nbe set to not request, but accept time synchronization requests from the master \n(TIMERQn = M for “master”).\nIf the relay time is only synchronized over DNP, the relay time is considered \nsynchronized for a period based on the TIMERQ port setting. When the \nTIMERQ setting is less than 30 minutes, the relay time is considered \nsynchronized for two times the TIMERQ setting. When the TIMERQ setting \nis greater than 30 minutes, the relay time is considered synchronized for \n30 minutes plus the TIMERQ setting. When TIMERQ is not set to a time \n(TIMERQ = M) for any port, the time is considered synchronized for \n60 minutes. When the device time is considered synchronized, an Object 2, \nVariation 3 (Binary Input Event with Relative Time) request will result in an \nObject 51, Variation 1 (Time and Date Common Time-of-Occurrence \nsynchronized) response. When the device time is no longer considered \nsynchronized, an Object 2, Variation 3 (Binary Input Event with Relative \nTime) request will result in an Object 51, Variation 2 (Time and Date \nCommon Time-of-Occurrence unsynchronized) response.\nGlobal setting DNPSRC controls the time base for DNP time. If the master \nsends time in UTC, set DNPSRC to UTC. If the master sends local time, set \nDNPSRC to Local.\n\nTable L.6 SEL-311C Event Buffer Capacity\n\nType Maximum Number of Events\n\nBinary 1024\nAnalog 200\n\nCounters 8\n\n\n\nL.10\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nDNP3 Communications\nDNP3 in the SEL-311C\n\nDNP3 Settings The DNP3 port configuration settings available on the SEL-311C are shown in \nTable L.7. You can enable DNP3 on any of the serial Ports 1, 2, 3, or F or on \nEthernet Port 5, as many as a maximum of six concurrent DNP3 sessions. All \nsix DNP sessions can be on the Ethernet port, or on four separate serial ports, \nor a combination of the two. See Table 10.8 for DNP protocol session \nlimitations.\n\nEach session defines the characteristics of the connected DNP3 Master, to \nwhich you assign one of the three available custom maps. Some settings only \napply to DNP3 LAN/WAN, and are visible only when configuring the \nEthernet port. For example, you only have the ability to define multiple \nsessions (as many as six) on Port 5, the Ethernet port. For this reason, DNP \nsettings for Ethernet sessions have a suffix n that indicates the session number \nfrom one to six, for example, DNPIP1, ETIMEO2, and AGE1EVE3. Serial \nDNP3 ports do not support multiple sessions, so they do not have the suffix n.\n\nTable L.7 Port DNP3 Protocol Settings (Sheet 1 of 3)\n\nName Description Range Default\n\nSerial Port 1–4 Settings\n\nDNPADR Device DNP3 address 0–65519 0\nREPADR DNP3 address of the Master to send messages to 0–65519 0\nDNPMAP DNP3 Session Custom Map 1–3 1\nDVARAI Analog Input Default Variation 1–6 4\nECLASSB Class for binary event data, 0 disables 0–3 1\nECLASSC Class for counter event data, 0 disables 0–3 0\nECLASSA Class for analog event data, 0 disables 0–3 2\nDECPLA Decimal places scaling for Current data 0–3 1\nDECPLV Decimal places scaling for Voltage data 0–3 1\nDECPLM Decimal places scaling for Miscellaneous data 0–3 1\nANADBA Analog reporting dead band for current;

You can also use the ACSELERATOR \nQuickSet® SEL-5030 Software, which is recommended for this purpose.\nThe following are valid entries if you choose to use the SET D command to \ncreate or edit custom maps:\n\n➤ Binary Inputs—Any Relay Word bit label or additional DNP Binary \nInput (see Binary Inputs on page L.30), the values 0 or 1, or NA\n\n➤ Binary Outputs—Any Remote bit label or pair, Breaker bit \nlabel or pair, or additional DNP Binary Output (see Binary \nOutputs on page L.30), or NA\n\n\n\nL.26\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nDNP3 Communications\nDNP3 Documentation\n\n➤ Analog Inputs—Any Analog Input Quantity (see Analog \nInputs on page L.32) with scaling and/or dead-band value, e.g., \nIA:0.1:50 (see below), the values 0 or 1, or NA \n\n➤ Analog Outputs—Any Analog Output label (see Table L.10), \nNOOP, or NA\n\n➤ Counter Inputs—Any counter label (see Table L.10)\nFor the above custom map settings, a label of 0 or 1 shall yield the label value \nwhen the point is polled. A NOOP can be used as a placeholder for analog \noutputs—control of a point with this label does not change any relay values \nnor respond with an error message. Any gaps left in the custom map between \nlabels (NA) will be removed and the contents packed.\nYou can customize the DNP3 analog input map with per-point scaling and \ndead-band settings. Class scaling (DECPLA, DECPLV, and DECPLM) and \ndead-band (ANADBA, ANADBV, and ANADBM) settings are applied to \nindices that do not have per-point entries. Per-point dead-band settings \noverride any class dead-band settings. Per-point scaling overrides any class \nscaling, and multiplies the analog input by the scaling value. Unlike per-point \nscaling, class-level scaling is specified by an integer in the range 0–3 \n(inclusive), which indicates the number of decimal place shifts. In other \nwords, you should select 0 to multiply by 1, 1 for 10, 2 for 100, or 3 for 1000.\n\nPer-point scaling factors allow you to overcome the limitations imposed, by \ndefault, of the integer nature of Objects 30 and 32. For example, DNP in the \nSEL-311C, by default, truncates a value of 11.4 amps to 11 amps. You may \nuse per-point scaling to include decimal point values by multiplying by a \npower of 10. For example, if you use 10 as a scaling factor, 11.4 amps will be \ntransmitted as 114. You must divide the value by 10 in the master to see the \noriginal value including one decimal place.\n\nYou can also use per-point scaling to avoid overflowing the 16-bit maximum \ninteger value of 32767. For example, if you have a value that can reach \n157834, you cannot send it using DNP3 16-bit analog object variations. You \ncould use a scaling factor of 0.1 so that the maximum value reported is 15783. \nYou can then multiply the value by 10 in the master to see a value of 157830. \nYou will lose some precision as the last digit is truncated off in the scaling \nprocess, but you can transmit the scaled value using the default variations for \nDNP3 Objects 30 and 32.\nIf your DNP3 master has the capability to request floating-point analog input \nvariations, the SEL-311C will support them. These floating point variations, 5 \nand 6 for Object 30 and 5 through 8 for Object 32, allow the transmission of \n16- or 32-bit floating point values to DNP3 masters. When implemented, \nthese variations eliminate the need for scaling and still maintain the resolution \nof the relay analog values. Note that this support is greater than DNP3 Level 4 \nfunctionality, so you must confirm that your DNP3 master can work with \nthese variations before you consider using unscaled analog values.\n\nIf it is important to maintain tight data coherency (that is, all data read of a \ncertain type was sampled or calculated at the same time), then you should \ngroup that data together within your custom map. For example, if you want all \nthe currents to be coherent, you should group points IA_MAG, IB_MAG, \nIC_MAG, and IN_MAG together in the custom map. If points are not grouped \ntogether, they might not come from the same data sample.\n\nThe following example describes how to create a custom DNP3 map by point \ntype. The example demonstrates the SEL ASCII command SET D for each \npoint type, but the entire configuration may be completed without saving \n\n\n\nL.27\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nDNP3 Communications\nDNP3 Documentation\n\nchanges between point types.

The default variation for both static and event inputs is 2. Only the \nRead function code (1) is allowed with these objects. All variations are \nsupported. Object 2, variation 3 will be responded to, but will contain no data.\nBinary Inputs are scanned approximately once per second to generate events. When \ntime is reported with these event objects, it is the time at which the scanner observed \nthe bit change. This may be significantly delayed from when the original source \nchanged and should not be used for sequence-of-events determination. Binary inputs \nregistered with SER are derived from the SER and carry the time stamp of actual \noccurrence. Some additional binary inputs are available only to DNP: RLYDIS is \nderived from the relay status variable; STWARN and STFAIL are derived from the \ndiagnostic task data; UNRDEV & NUNREV are derived from the event queue. \nAnother binary input, STSET, is derived from the SER and carries the time stamp of \nactual occurrence. Static reads of this input will always show 0.\n\nBinary Outputs\nBinary Outputs are supported as defined in Table L.9 and Table L.10. Binary \nOutput status (Object 10 variation 2) is supported. Static reads of points RB1–\nRB32 respond with the online bit set and the state of the requested bit. Reads \nof NXTEVE respond with the online bit set and a state of 1 if event summary \ndata are being read in Multiple-Event FIFO mode and a state of 0 otherwise. \nReads of SINGEVE respond with the online bit set and a state of 1 when event \nsummary data are being read in Single-Event mode and a state of 0 when \nEvent Summary Data are being read in Multiple-Event mode. Reads from OC, \nCC, and control-only binary output points (such as the data reset controls \nDRST_DEM and DRST_ENE) respond with the on-line bit set and a state of 0 \n(or tripped) because of the pulse only control operation of these points.\nControl Relay Output Block (CROB) objects (Object 12, Variations 1, 2, and \n3) are supported. The control relays correspond to the remote bits and other \nlabels as shown in Table L.13 through Table L.16. The Trip/Close bits take \nprecedence over the control field. CROB operations are not guaranteed to \noccur during the same processing interval.\n\nOperation of the binary outputs is controlled by the Global settings \nBOOPTCC and BOOPPUL. BOOPTCC controls how binary outputs respond \nto Close and Trip operations. BOOPPUL controls how the binary outputs \nrespond to Pulse On operations. Each setting has two choices, SET and \nPULSE. The response of various outputs for different settings of BOOPTCC \nand BOOPPUL is shown in Table L.13 through Table L.16. Note that the \noperation of remote bit and OC:CC pairs is not affected by these settings, nor \nis the operation of any binary outputs for Latch On and Latch Off operations.\n\nTable L.13 BOOPTCC = PULSE, BOOPPUL = PULSE \n\nLabel Close (0x4X) Trip (0x8X) Latch On (3) Latch Off (4) Pulse On (1) Pulse Off (2)\n\nRBx Pulse Pulse Set Clear Pulse Clear\n\nOC and CC Pulse Pulse Pulse Do nothing Pulse Do Nothing\n\nResetsa\n\na DRST_DEM, DRST_ENE, DRST_BK, DRST_MML, DRST_HIS, DRST_PDM, DRST_TAR, DRST_HAL, and DRSTDNPE.\n\nPulse Pulse Pulse Do nothing Pulse Do Nothing\n\nNXTEVE Read Oldest Read Oldest Read Oldest Read Newest Read Oldest Read Newest\n\nSINGEVE Pulse Pulse Pulse Do nothing Pulse Do Nothing\n\nRBx:RBy Pulse RBy Pulse RBx Pulse RBy Pulse RBx Pulse RBy Pulse RBx\n\nOC:CC Pulse CC Pulse OC Pulse CC Pulse OC Pulse CC Pulse OC\n\n\n\nL.31\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nDNP3 Communications\nDNP3 Documentation\n\nThe Status field is used exactly as defined.

Supported variations are shown in \nTable L.9. Event class messages are generated whenever a counter changes \nbeyond the value given by the appropriate dead-band setting. For example, \nwith a dead band of 1 and a starting value of 5, when the counter changes from \n5 to 6, no event will be generated. When the value changes from 6 to 7, an \nevent will be generated and the new starting value will be 7. The default \ncounter dead-band setting is 0. A per-point dead band can be applied to a \ncounter object by adding the dead band after the object label in the DNP map \n(i.e., INTTR:2). The per-point dead band overrides the default dead band. \nCounters are scanned at approximately a one-second rate and are time-\nstamped with the time the scan was initiated.\n\nAnalog Inputs\nAnalog Inputs (Object 30) and Analog Change Events (Object 32) are \nsupported as defined in Table L.9 and Table L.10, with the default variation \nbased on the Serial Port setting DVARAI and the Ethernet port setting \nDVARAIn, where n denotes the Ethernet session being used. Analog values \nare reported in primary units. See Appendix E: Analog Quantities for a list of \nall available analog inputs, and the DNP Reference map for default scaling \nand dead bands. A dead-band check is done after any scaling has been applied. \nEvent class messages are generated whenever an input changes beyond the \nvalue given by the appropriate dead-band setting. Analog inputs are scanned at \napproximately a 1 second rate, except for Fault analog inputs below. The \nANADBA setting applies to the same values as the DECPLA settings. The \nANADBV setting applies to the same values as the DECPLV setting. The \nANADBM setting applies to all other analog input items. All events generated \nduring a scan will use the time the scan was initiated.\n\nEvent Data\nThe following Fault Analog Inputs are derived from the history queue data for \nthe most recently read event: FTYPE, FTYPE16, FLOC, FI, FIA, FIB, FIC, \nFIG, FIN, FIQ, FFREQ, FGRP, FSHO, FTIMEH, FTIMEM, FTIMEL, \nFTIMEH16, FTIMEM16, FTIMEL16, FUNR, FZ, FZFA, FR, and FM. These \nquantities, also referred to as the DNP event registers, shall generate DNP3 \nanalog change events (Object 32). Because these DNP event registers refer to \n\nTable L.17 Example Object 12 Trip/Close or Code Selection Operation \n(BOOPTCC = PULSE and BOOPPUL = PULSE)\n\nControl Points\nTrip/Close Code Selection Operation\n\nClose (0x4X) Trip (0x8X) Latch On (3) Latch Off (4) Pulse On (1) Pulse Off (2)\n\nRB1:RB2 PULSE RB2 PULSE RB1 PULSE RB2 PULSE RB1 PULSE RB2 PULSE RB1\nRB3 PULSE RB3 PULSE RB3 SET RB3 CLEAR RB3 PULSE RB3 CLEAR RB3\nRB4 PULSE RB4 PULSE RB4 SET RB4 CLEAR RB4 PULSE RB4 CLEAR RB4\n\nRB5:RB6 PULSE RB6 PULSE RB5 PULSE RB6 PULSE RB5 PULSE RB6 PULSE RB5\nRB7 PULSE RB7 PULSE RB7 SET RB7 CLEAR RB7 PULSE RB7 CLEAR RB7\nRB8 PULSE RB8 PULSE RB8 SET RB8 CLEAR RB8 PULSE RB8 CLEAR RB8\n\nRB14:RB15 PULSE RB15 PULSE RB14 PULSE RB15 PULSE RB14 PULSE RB15 PULSE RB14\nRB18:RB21 PULSE RB21 PULSE RB18 PULSE RB21 PULSE RB18 PULSE RB21 PULSE RB18\n\n\n\nL.33\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nDNP3 Communications\nDNP3 Documentation\n\nthe same event summary record, the relay creates analog change events for all \nof these DNP event registers when any one of the registers exceeds its dead \nband. Events for these inputs will use the time the scan was initiated.\n\nAnalog input FLOC is the Fault Location value. If this field contains \n“$$$$$$” (undetermined location) or is blank (when EFLOC = N), the relay \nwill set the internal value of FLOC to –999.9 for DNP3. As with most of the \nevent register values, FLOC is subject to scaling by the DECPLM setting \n(1 by default). So by default, a DNP3 poll of this value under the above \nconditions would yield a value of –9999.0 at the master. This value was \nchosen to represent an undetermined or blank FLOC that would not create \nnuisance alarms by presenting an over-range value to a DNP3 master. Note \nthat if DECPLM is changed, this will change the end value of this point at the \nDNP3 master. If DECPLM is changed, you should set per-point scaling to \n1 for FLOC to override the DECPLM scaling and ensure that it is transmitted \nas expected.\n\nAnalog input FTYPE is a 16-bit composite value where the upper byte value \nindicates an event cause as shown in Table L.18 and the lower byte indicates a \nfault type as shown in Table L.19. The upper and lower byte will be the sum of \nthe applicable event cause and fault types. For example, a FTYPE value of \n3079 decimal would translate to 0C07 hex, and indicate a Trip and an ER \nelement Event Cause (4 + 8 = 12 or 0C hex) on A-phase, B-phase, and C-\nphase (1 + 2 + 4 = 7 or 07 hex). If input FTYPE is 0, fault information has not \nyet been read and the fault analog inputs do not contain valid event data.\n\nIn some instances, the values in the FTIMEx registers and FTYPE register \nmay contain a value greater than 32767, which can be read correctly using \nObject 30, Variation 1 or 3 (32-bit value). However, some DNP masters cannot \nread a 32-bit value, so the 16-bit variations (2 and 4) clamp the value and \nVariation 2 reports an over-range flag. FTYPE16, FTIMEH16, FTIMEM16, \nand FTIMEL16 contain a 16-bit signed value that can be read using \nVariation 2 or 4. The FTIMEx 16 and FTYPE16 registers contain the FTIMEx \nor FTYPE value minus 65536 if the value is greater than 32767. The value is \nreported as a negative number without an over-range flag.\n\nSettings Data\nAnalog inputs 51PP, 51GP, and 51QP are derived from the present active \ngroup settings. If the associated setting is set to off, the value will be reported \nas –1. Please note that these values are subject to scaling by the DECPLA \n\nTable L.18 Fault Type Upper Byte: Event Cause\n\nValue Event Cause\n\n1 Trigger command\n2 Pulse command\n4 Trip element\n8 ER element\n\nTable L.19 Fault Type Lower Byte: Fault Type\n\nValue Fault Type\n\n0 Indeterminate\n1 A Phase\n2 B Phase\n4 C Phase\n8 Ground\n\n\n\nL.34\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nDNP3 Communications\nDNP3 Documentation\n\nsetting (i.e., you will see a value of –10 for OFF with the default DECPLA \nsetting). You may override the default scaling by applying per-point scaling to \nthese values in a custom DNP map.\n\nReading Relay \nEvent Data\n\nThe SEL-311C provides protective relay event history information in either \nsingle or multiple-event mode. Event Data on page L.32 describes the analog \nDNP event registers that are updated for the most recently read event from the \nevent history. When in single-event mode, the relay makes event data available \nin the DNP event registers as described in Single-Event Mode on page L.35. \nWhen in multiple-event mode, the relay makes event data available in the \nDNP event registers as described in Multiple-Event Mode on page L.35.\n\nEach DNP session starts up in the mode specified by Port setting EVEMODE \nwhen the relay turns on, when there is a DNP port settings change, a DNP map \nchange, or a SER settings change. When EVEMODE = SINGLE, the relay \nstarts up in single-event mode. When EVEMODE = MULTI, the relay starts \nup in multiple-event mode. \n\nThe reporting method can also be changed by asserting a binary output control \npoint. The relay changes to multiple-event mode on a per-session basis if the \nNXTEVE control point is operated on. The relay changes to single-event \nmode on a per-session basis if the SINGEVE control point is operated on. A \nrelay turning on, a DNP port settings change, a DNP map change, or an SER \nsettings change returns the reporting method to the mode specified by \nEVEMODE. When switching from multiple-event mode to single-event \nmode, the DNP event registers are set to zero.\n\nFor single-event mode, all registers except FUNR update when a new event \noccurs. For multiple-event mode, the only register that will update when a new \nevent occurs is FUNR. DNP3 masters configured to use multiple-event mode \nmust monitor at least one of the analog DNP event registers to detect if the \nrelay has transitioned to single-event mode. If only one of the registers is \nmonitored, that register cannot be FUNR because FUNR does not update for \nsingle-event mode. If changes are detected in the analog DNP event registers, \nthe DNP3 master should latch on or latch off NXTEVE to put the relay into \nmultiple-event mode.\n\nEvent summary data are only generated for events that have occurred since the \nlast power up, within the limits of the DNP event buffer. Upon an initial switch \nfrom single-event mode to multiple-event mode, all existing events since \npower up are considered unread. Once an event is read via FIFO, it is no \nlonger available via LIFO and vice-versa. FIFO and LIFO are discussed in \nMultiple-Event Mode on page L.35. The user cannot traverse event summaries \nforward, then backwards. After the initial switch from single-event mode to \nmultiple-event mode, when switching to single-event mode by operating \nSINGEVE, the DNP event registers are set to zero but the DNP event buffer is \nnot reset. For example, if the relay is in single-event mode, three events occur, \nand the relay is switched to multiple-event mode by latching on NXTEVE, a \nread of the analog DNP event registers will show data for the oldest event and \nFUNR will be equal to 2. If the relay is switched to single-event mode by \noperating SINGEVE, a read of the analog DNP event registers will show that \nthey are all zero but the DNP event buffer will still contain two unread events. \nThis can be seen by latching on NXTEVE to switch back to multiple-event \nmode. Once in multiple-event mode, a read of the analog DNP event registers \nwill show data for the oldest event and FUNR will be equal to 1, indicating \nthat there is still one unread event in the DNP event buffer. Note that the \nswitching between modes is not normal behavior for a DNP master and is only \ndiscussed here to illustrate the DNP event buffer functionality when switching \nmodes.\n\n\n\nL.35\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nDNP3 Communications\nDNP3 Documentation\n\nPort setting RPEVTYP controls the type of events that are reported to the \nrelay DNP event summary. When Port setting RPEVTYP = TRIP, only TRIP \nevents are reported in the DNP event summary data. When Port setting \nRPEVTYP = ALL, all events are reported in the DNP event summary data.\n\nThe Port settings MINDIST and MAXDIST can be used to limit fault \nsummary data to only data within a certain fault distance. If MINDIST and \nMAXDIST are set to a numeric value, DNP events will only be generated \nwhen the fault location is within these setting values. If MINDIST is set to \nOFF, there is no lower limit for the fault location distance. If MAXDIST is set \nto OFF, there is no upper limit for the fault location distance. If the fault \nlocation is undetermined, the event is displayed regardless of the MINDIST \nand MAXDIST settings but is constrained by the RPEVTYP setting.\n\nSELOGIC control equation RSTDNPE is used to clear the DNP event registers \nand the DNP event buffer for both single-event mode and multiple-event mode \nfor all DNP sessions. When RSTDNPE is evaluated to one, the DNP event \nregisters are set to zero and the DNP event buffer is cleared. The DNP binary \noutput DRSTDNPE is similar in function to RSTDNPE and can also be used \nto clear the DNP event registers and the DNP event buffer when the relay is in \nsingle-event mode or multiple-event mode on a per-session basis.\n\nSingle-Event Mode\nSingle-event mode provides the most recent event report summary data as they \noccur in the relay. When a new event report is triggered (TRIP, ER assert, TRI, \netc.), the new event data are stored in DNP event registers as long as the Port \nsettings RPEVTYP, MINDIST, and MAXDIST criteria are satisfied. When \nthe DNP event registers are updated, a DNP3 event is generated. The event \nreport summary values are locked into the DNP event registers for the time \ndetermined by Global setting EVELOCK. Additional event reports triggered \nbefore the EVELOCK timer expires are ignored by DNP3. EVELOCK = 0 \ndefeats the lock function, and allows the DNP event registers to be updated as \nsoon as a new event report is triggered. EVELOCK has no effect when the \nsession is in multiple-event mode.\n\nMultiple-Event Mode\nMultiple-event mode provides the most recent event report summary data \nwhen the master sends a latch-on or latch-off control to NXTEVE. Anytime \nthere are unread event data, UNRDEV will be asserted and FUNR will \nrepresent the number of unread event reports.\n\nWhen the session DNP3 master sends a latch-on control to NXTEVE, the \noldest unread event summary data are transferred to the DNP event registers. \nTo check for more available unread event summary data, read the UNRDEV \nbinary input. If UNRDEV is asserted, then more event data exist. Use the \nNXTEVE binary output and UNRDEV binary input to create an event \nsummary data FIFO. If UNRDEV is asserted, send a latch-on control to \nNXTEVE, read the event summary data, and read UNRDEV again. Repeat \nuntil UNRDEV is cleared. Sending a latch-on control to NXTEVE while \nUNRDEV is cleared sets the analog event data registers to zero.\n\nWhen the session DNP3 master sends a latch-off control to NXTEVE, the \nnewest unread event summary data are transferred to the DNP event registers. \nTo check for more available unread event summary data, read the UNRDEV \nbinary input. If UNRDEV is asserted, then more event data exist. This \nsequence steps through the event summary data from newest to oldest, \nforming a LIFO. It is possible that, while stepping through the event summary \ndata from newest to oldest, a new event will be triggered. In that case, the \n\n\n\nL.36\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nDNP3 Communications\nDNP3 Documentation\n\nbinary input NUNREV asserts, and the next event summary is from the most \nrecently triggered event. Subsequent latch-off controls to NXTEVE resume \nwith the next newest unread event summary, skipping all the event summaries \nalready read. Sending a latch-off control to NXTEVE while UNRDEV is \ncleared sets the analog event data registers to zero.\n\nIn either FIFO or LIFO mode, if the session DNP master latches NXTEVE \nmore often than once per two seconds, some DNP events may not be \ngenerated by the new event summary data and event summary data may be \nlost.\n\n\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nDate _______________ 1 of 14DNP Settings Sheets\nDNP Map Settings (SET D n Command)\n\nDNP Settings Sheets\nInstruction Manual\n\nDNP Map Settings (SET D n Command)\nUse SET D n command with n = 1, 2, or 3 to create as many as three DNP User Maps.

Protocol\n\nOverview\nThis appendix describes special binary Fast Sequential Events Recorder \n(SER) messages that are not included in Section 10: Communications. \nDevices with embedded processing capability can use these messages to \nenable and accept unsolicited binary Fast SER messages from the SEL-311C \nRelay. Unsolicited Fast SER messages can be enabled on multiple serial and \nEthernet ports simultaneously, as shown in Table 10.7.\n\nSEL relays and communications processors have two separate data streams \nthat share the same serial port. The normal serial interface consists of ASCII \ncharacter commands and reports that are intelligible using a terminal or \nterminal emulation package. The binary data streams can interrupt the ASCII \ndata stream to obtain information, and then allow the ASCII data stream to \ncontinue. This mechanism allows a single communications channel to be used \nfor ASCII communications (e.g., transmission of a long event report) \ninterleaved with short bursts of binary data to support fast acquisition of \nmetering or SER data. To exploit this feature, the device connected to the \nother end of the link requires software that uses the separate data streams. The \nbinary commands and ASCII commands can also be accessed by a device that \ndoes not interleave the data streams.\n\nSequential Events Recorder (SER) Storage \nConsiderations\n\nThe relay captures a record in the Sequential Events Recorder (SER) event \nreport for any change of state in any one of the elements listed in the SER1, \nSER2, or SER3 trigger settings. Nonvolatile memory is used to store the latest \n1024 rows of the SER event report so they can be retained during power loss. \nThe nonvolatile memory is rated for a finite number of writes. Exceeding the \nlimit can result in an EEPROM self-test failure. An average of one state \nchange every three minutes can be made for a 25-year relay service life.\nThe Fast SER event buffer stores the most recent 512 events in volatile \nmemory. If the relay loses power and event messages have not been sent, Fast \nSER will not send those messages upon power up. An enable message must be \nsent to the relay to begin the transmission of Fast SER messages.\n\n\n\nM.2\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nFast SER Protocol\nRecommended Message Usage\n\nRecommended Message Usage\nUse the following sequence of commands to enable unsolicited binary Fast \nSER messaging in the SEL-311C:\n\n1. On initial connection, send the SNS command (see Appendix J: \nConfiguration, Fast Meter, and Fast Operate Commands) to \nretrieve and store the ASCII names for the digital I/O points \nassigned to trigger SER records.\n\nThe order of the ASCII names matches the point indices in the \nunsolicited binary Fast SER messages. Send the “Enable \nUnsolicited Fast SER Data Transfer” message to enable the \nSEL-311C to transmit unsolicited binary Fast SER messages.\n\n2. When SER records are triggered in the SEL-311C, the relay \nresponds with an unsolicited binary Fast SER message. If this \nmessage has a valid checksum, it must be acknowledged by \nsending an acknowledge message with the same response \nnumber as contained in the original message. The relay will \nwait approximately 100 ms to 500 ms to receive an \nacknowledge message, at which time the relay will resend the \nsame unsolicited Fast SER message with the same response \nnumber five times before suspending the message transmission. \nAn enable message must be sent to the relay to begin sending \nthe Fast SER messages again.\n\n3. Upon receiving an acknowledge message with a matching \nresponse number, the relay increments the response number, \nand continues to send and seek acknowledgment for unsolicited \nFast SER messages, if additional SER records are available. \nWhen the response number reaches three it wraps around to \nzero on the next increment.\n\nFunctions and Function Codes\nIn the messages shown below, all numbers are in hexadecimal, unless \notherwise noted. \n\n01—Function Code: \nEnable Unsolicited \nFast SER Data \nTransfer, Sent From \nMaster to Relay\n\nUpon power-up, the SEL-311C disables its own unsolicited transmissions. \nThis function enables the SEL-311C to begin sending unsolicited data to the \ndevice that sent the enable message, if the SEL-311C has such data to transfer. \nThe message format for function code 01 is shown in Table M.1.\n\nTable M.1 Function Code 01 Message Format (Sheet 1 of 2)\n\nData Description\n\nA546 Message header\n\n12 Message length in bytes (18 decimal)\n0000000000 Five bytes reserved for future use as a routing address\n\nYY Status byte (LSB = 1 indicates an acknowledge is requested)\n01 Function code\n\nC0 Sequence byte (Always C0. Other values are reserved for future use in \nmultiple frame messages.)\n\n\n\nM.3\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nFast SER Protocol\nFunctions and Function Codes\n\nThe SEL-311C verifies the message by checking the header, length, function \ncode, and enabled function code against the expected values. It also checks the \nentire message against the CRC-16 field. If any of the checks fail, except the \nfunction code or the function to enable, the message is ignored.\n\nIf an acknowledge is requested as indicated by the least significant bit of the \nstatus byte, the relay transmits an acknowledge message with the same \nresponse number received in the enable message.\n\nThe “nn” field is used to set the maximum number of SER records per \nmessage. The relay checks for SER records approximately every 500 ms. If \nthere are new records available, the relay immediately creates a new \nunsolicited Fast SER message and transmits it. If there are more than “nn” \nnew records available, or if the first and last record are separated by more than \n16 seconds, the relay will break the transmission into multiple messages so \nthat no message contains more than “nn” records, and the first and last record \nof each message are separated by no more than 16 seconds.\n\nIf the function to enable is not 18 or the function code is not recognized, the \nrelay responds with an acknowledge message containing a response code 01 \n(function code unrecognized), and no functions are enabled. If the SER \ntriggers are disabled (SER1, SER2, and SER3 are all set to NA), the \nunsolicited Fast SER messages are still enabled, but the only SER records \ngenerated are due to settings changes and power being applied to the relay. If \nthe SER1, SER2, or SER3 settings are subsequently changed to any non-NA \nvalue and SER entries are triggered, unsolicited SER messages will be \ngenerated with the new SER records.\n\n02—Function Code: \nDisable Unsolicited \nFast SER Data \nTransfer, Sent From \nMaster to Relay\n\nThis function disables the SEL-311C from transferring unsolicited data.

Synchrophasor is used as a \ngeneral term that can refer to data or protocol.\n\nThis section covers the following topics:\n\n➤ Introduction\n\n➤ Synchrophasor Measurement on page N.2\n\n➤ Settings for IEEE C37.118 Protocol Synchrophasors on \npage N.5\n\n➤ C37.118 Synchrophasor Protocol on page N.13\n\n➤ Synchrophasor Relay Word Bits on page N.16\n\n➤ View Synchrophasors by Using the MET PM Command on \npage N.17\n\n➤ SEL Fast Message Synchrophasor Protocol on page N.21\n\n➤ Configuring High-Accuracy Timekeeping on page N.27\n➤ Synchrophasor Protocols and SEL Fast Operate Commands on \n\npage N.31\n\nIntroduction\nThe word synchrophasor is derived from two words: synchronized and phasor. \nSynchrophasor measurement refers to the concept of providing measurements \ntaken on a synchronized schedule in multiple locations. A high-accuracy \nclock, commonly a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver such as the \nSEL-2407® Satellite-Synchronized Clock, makes synchrophasor \nmeasurement possible.\n\nThe availability of an accurate time reference over a large geographic area \nallows multiple devices, such as a number of SEL-311C relays, to synchronize \nthe gathering of power system data. The accurate clock allows precise event \nreport triggering and other off-line analysis functions.\n\nThe SEL-311C Global settings contain the synchrophasor settings, including \nthe choice of synchrophasor protocol and the synchrophasor data set the relay \nwill transmit. The Port settings select which serial port(s) are reserved for \nsynchrophasor protocol use and enables synchrophasors on Ethernet ports. \nSee Settings for IEEE C37.118 Protocol Synchrophasors on page N.5.\n\n\n\nN.2\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nSynchrophasors\nSynchrophasor Measurement\n\nThe SEL-311C generates time status Relay Word bits and time-quality \ninformation that is important for synchrophasor measurement. Some \nprotection SELOGIC® variables and programmable digital trigger information \n(C37.118 protocol only) are also added to the Relay Word bits for \nsynchrophasors—see Synchrophasor Relay Word Bits on page N.16.\n\nThe value of synchrophasor data increases greatly when the data can be shared \nover a communications network in real time. Two synchrophasor protocols are \navailable in the SEL-311C that allow for a centralized device to collect data \nefficiently from several phasor measurement units (PMUs). Some possible \nuses of a system-wide synchrophasor system include the following:\n\n➤ Power-system state measurement \n\n➤ Wide-area network protection and control schemes\n\n➤ Small-signal analysis\n\n➤ Power-system disturbance analysis\n\nIn any installation, the SEL-311C can use only one of the synchrophasor \nprotocols, SEL Fast Message Synchrophasor, or C37.118, as selected by \nGlobal setting MFRMT. When MFRMT = FM, SEL Fast Message \nsynchrophasor data are available on multiple serial ports when the port setting \nPROTO = SEL. When MFRMT = C37.118, IEEE C37.118 compliant \nsynchrophasor data are available on multiple serial ports when the port setting \nPROTO = PMU and on Ethernet Ports when port setting EPMIP = Y. Use \neither the SEL or C37.118 protocol to create control schemes by making port \nsetting FASTOP = Y.\n\nYou can view synchrophasor data over a serial port set to PROTO = SEL, see \nView Synchrophasors by Using the MET PM Command on page N.17.\n\nSEL Fast Message synchrophasor protocol is able to share the same physical \nport with separate data streams (see Overview on page J.1).\n\nSynchrophasor Measurement\nThe phasor measurement unit in the SEL-311C measures four voltages and \nfour currents on a constant-time basis. These samples are synchronized to the \nhigh-accuracy IRIG-B time source, and occur at a fixed frequency of either \n60 Hz or 50 Hz, depending on Global setting NFREQ. The relay then filters \nthe measured samples according to Global setting PMAPP = F or N—see \nPMAPP on page N.6. The phase angle is measured relative to an absolute \nreference, which is represented by a cosine function in Figure N.1. The time-\nof-day is shown for the two time marks.\n\nFigure N.1 High-Accuracy Clock Controls Reference Signal (60 Hz System)\n\nNOTE: The synchrophasor data \nstream is separate from the other \nprotection and metering functions.\n\n10:00:00.000000 10:00:00.016667\n\nt\n\n\n\nN.3\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nSynchrophasors\nSynchrophasor Measurement\n\nThe instrument transformers (PTs or CTs) and the interconnecting cables may \nintroduce a time shift in the measured signal. Global settings VPCOMP, \nVSCOMP, IPCOMP, and INCOMP, entered in degrees, are added to the \nmeasured phasor angles to create the corrected phasor angles, as shown in \nFigure N.2. The VPCOMP, VSCOMP, IPCOMP, and INCOMP settings may \nbe positive or negative values. The corrected angles are displayed in the MET \nPM command and transmitted as part of synchrophasor messages.\n\nFigure N.2 Waveform at Relay Terminals May Have Phase Shift\n\nEquation N.1\n\nIf the time shift on the pt measurement path tpt = 0.784 ms and the nominal \nfrequency, freqnominal = 60Hz, use Equation N.2 to obtain the correction \nangle: \n\n. Equation N.2\n\nFigure N.3 Correction of Measured Phase Angle\n\nFor a sinusoidal signal, the phasor magnitude is calculated as shown in \nEquation N.3. The phasors are rms values scaled in primary units, as \ndetermined by Group settings PTR, PTRS, CTR, and CTRN. The SEL-311C \nthen calculates the positive-sequence voltage and currents.\n\nEquation N.3\n\n94.851\n\n–94.851\n\nΔtpt\n\n0 t\n\nVA(t)\n\nmeasured\nwaveform\n\nactual\nwaveform\n\nCompensation Angle \ntpt\n\n1\nfreq\n----------  \n\n---------------- 360• =\n\n tpt freq 360• • =\n\n0.784 10 3– s 60s 1– 360• • • 16.934=\nImaginary\n\nReal\nM\n\nM\nVA measured\n\nVA corrected\n\nCompensation Angle\n\nMagnitude M\nVpk\n\n2\n--------- PTRsetting• =\n\n\n\nN.4\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nSynchrophasors\nSynchrophasor Measurement\n\nWith PTR = 2000, and the signal in Figure N.2 (with peak voltage \nVpk = 94.851 V), use Equation N.4 to obtain the magnitude, VA_MAG:\n\nEquation N.4\n\nFinally, the magnitude and angle pair for each synchrophasor is converted to a \nreal and imaginary pair using Equation N.5 and Equation N.6. For example, \nanalog quantities VA_MAG and VA_ANG are converted to VA_REAL and \nVA_IMG. An example phasor with an angle measurement of 104.400° is \nshown in Figure N.4.\n\nFigure N.4 Example Calculation of Real and Imaginary Components of \nSynchrophasor\n\nEquation N.5\n\nEquation N.6\n\nUsing the magnitude M from Equation N.5, the real part is given in \nEquation N.7.\n\nEquation N.7\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part is calculated in Equation N.8\n\nEquation N.8\n\nBecause the sampling reference is based on the GPS clock (IRIG-B signal) \nand not synchronized to the power system, an examination of successive \nsynchrophasor data sets will almost always show some angular change \nbetween samples of the same signal. This is not a malfunction of the relay or \nthe power system, but is merely a result of viewing data from one system with \nan instrument with an independent time base. In other words, a power system \nhas a nominal frequency of either 50 or 60 Hz, but on closer examination, it is \nusually running a little faster or slower than nominal.\n\nVA_MAG 94.851\n2\n\n---------------- 2000• =\n\n134140 V=\n134.140 kV=\n\nVA_IMG =\n129.926 kV\n\nVA_ANG =\n104.400°\n\nVA_REAL = –33.359 kV\n\nReal\n\nVA_MAG =\n134.140 kV\n\nImaginary\n\nReal part M cos (angle)• =\n\nImaginary part M sin (angle)• =\n\nVA_REAL 134.140 kV cos 104.400• =\n-33.359 kV=\n\nVA_IMG 134.140 kV sin 104.400• =\n129.926 kV=\n\n\n\nN.5\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nSynchrophasors\nSettings for IEEE C37.118 Protocol Synchrophasors\n\nSettings for IEEE C37.118 Protocol Synchrophasors\nThe phasor measurement unit (PMU) settings are listed in Table N.1.

The SEL-311C includes the MFRMT = FM setting choice to maintain \ncompatibility in any systems presently using SEL Fast Message \nsynchrophasors. \n\nMRATE\nSelects the message rate in messages per second for synchrophasor data \nstreaming on serial ports.\n\nChoose the MRATE setting that suits the needs of your PMU application. This \nsetting is one of six settings that determine the minimum port SPEED necessary \nto support the synchrophasor data packet rate and size. See Communications \nBandwidth for C37.118 Protocol on page N.15 for detailed information.\n\nPMAPP\nSelects the type of digital filters used in the synchrophasor algorithm: \n\n➤ The Narrow Bandwidth setting (N) represents filters with a \ncutoff frequency approximately ¼ of MRATE. The response in \nthe frequency domain is narrower, and response in the time \ndomain is slower. This method results in synchrophasor data \nthat are free of aliasing signals and well suited for post-\ndisturbance analysis. \n\n➤ The Fast Response setting (F) represents filters with a higher \ncutoff frequency. The response in frequency domain is wider \nand the response in the time domain is faster. This method \nresults in synchrophasor data that can be used in synchrophasor \napplications requiring more speed in tracking system \nparameters.\n\nPHCOMP\nEnables or disables frequency-based compensation for synchrophasors.\n\nFor most applications, set PHCOMP = Y to activate the algorithm that \ncompensates for the magnitude and angle errors of synchrophasors for \nfrequencies that are off nominal.

The \ninclusion of digital data can help indicate breaker status or other operational \ndata to the synchrophasor processor. For example, because VS channel \nsynchrophasors are IEEE C37.118 Level 1 compliant only when the frequency \nis the same as the Phase A voltage, it may be desirable to monitor breaker \nposition to indicate when there might be a frequency difference. See IEEE \nC37.118 PMU Setting Example on page N.18 for a suggested use of the digital \nstatus word fields.\n\nSetting NUMDSW = 0 sends no user-definable digital status words.\n\nSetting NUMDSW = 1 sends the user-definable digital status words \ncontaining Relay Word bits SV1 through SV16.\n\nThe digital status words are sent after positive-sequence current in the \nsynchrophasor data packet starting with SV1 and continuing through SV16.\n\nTREA1, TREA2, TREA3, TREA4, and PMTRIG\nDefines the programmable trigger bits as allowed by IEEE C37.118.\n\nEach of the four Trigger Reason settings, TREA1–TREA4, and the PMU \nTrigger setting, PMTRIG, are SELOGIC control equations in Logic settings. \nThe SEL-311C evaluates these equations and places the results in Relay Word \nbits with the same names: TREA1–TREA4, and PMTRIG. \n\nNOTE: The PM Trigger function is \nnot associated with the SEL-311C \nEvent Report Trigger ER, a SELOGIC \ncontrol equation in Logic settings.\n\n\n\nN.10\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nSynchrophasors\nSerial Port Settings for IEEE C37.118 Synchrophasors\n\nThe trigger reason equations represent the Trigger Reason bits in the STAT \nfield of the data packet. After the trigger reason bits are set to convey a \nmessage, the PMTRIG Equation should be asserted for a reasonable amount \nof time, to allow the synchrophasor processor to read the TREA1–TREA4 \nfields.\n\nThe IEEE C37.118 standard defines the first eight of 16 binary combinations \nof these trigger reason bits (bits 0–3). The remaining eight binary \ncombinations are available for user definition.\n\nThe SEL-311C does not automatically set the TREA1–TREA4 or PMTRIG \nRelay Word bits—these bits must be programmed even for the eight \ncombinations defined by IEE C37.118.\n\nThese bits may be used to send various messages at a low bandwidth via the \nsynchrophasor message stream. Digital Status Words may also be used to send \nbinary information directly, without the need to manage the coding of the \ntrigger reason messages in SELOGIC control equations.\n\nUse these Trigger Reason bits if your synchrophasor system design requires \nthese bits. The SEL-311C synchrophasor processing and protocol \ntransmission are not affected by the status of these bits.\n\nSerial Port Settings for IEEE C37.118 \nSynchrophasors\n\nIEEE C37.118 compliant synchrophasors are available via serial or Ethernet \nport.

As more \nsynchrophasors or digital status words are added, or if the message rate is \nincreased, some communications channel restrictions come into play.\n\nIf the SPEED setting on any serial port set with PROTO = PMU is insufficient \nfor the PMU Global settings, the SEL-311C or SEL-5030 software will \ndisplay an error message and fail to save settings until the error is corrected.\n\nThe C37.118 synchrophasor message format always includes 18 bytes for the \nmessage header and terminal ID, time information, and status bits. The \nselection of synchrophasor data, numeric format, and programmable digital \ndata will add to the byte requirements. Table N.7 can be used to calculate the \nnumber of bytes in a synchrophasor message.\n\nTable N.8 lists the baud settings available on any SEL-311C serial port (setting SPEED), and the maximum \nmessage size that can fit within the port bandwidth. Blank entries indicate bandwidths of less than 20 bytes.\n\nReferring to Table N.7 and Table N.8, it is clear that the lower SPEED settings are very restrictive.\n\nThe smallest practical synchrophasor message would consist of one \nsynchrophasor, and this message would consume between 26 and 34 bytes, \ndepending on the numeric format settings. This type of message could be sent \n\nNOTE: There are no limitations \nplaced on the number of bytes in the \nsynchrophasor message and the \nmessage rate if only the Ethernet port \nis enabled for synchrophasors.\n\nTable N.7 Size of a C37.118 Synchrophasor Message\n\nItem\nPossible Number of \n\nQuantities \nBytes per \nQuantity\n\nMinimum Number \nof Bytes\n\nMaximum Number \nof Bytes\n\nFixed 18 18\n\nSynchrophasors 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, or 10 4 {PHNR = I}\n8 {PHNR = F}\n\n0 80\n\nFrequency 2 (fixed) 2 {FNR = I}\n4 {FNR = F}\n\n4 8\n\nDigital Status Words 0–1 2 0 2\n\nTotal (Minimum and Maximum) 22 108\n\nTable N.8 Serial Port Bandwidth for Synchrophasors (in Bytes) \n\nGlobal Setting \nMRATE\n\nPort Setting SPEED\n\n300 1200 2400 4800 9600 19200 38400 57600\n\n1 25 103 207 414 829 1658 3316 4974\n\n2 51 103 207 414 829 1658 2487\n\n4 (60 Hz only) 25 51 103 207 414 829 1243\n5 20 41 82 165 331 663 994\n\n10 20 41 82 165 331 497\n\n12 (60 Hz only) 34 69 138 276 414\n15 (60 Hz only) 27 55 110 221 331\n20 (60 Hz only) 20 41 82 165 248\n25 (50 Hz only) 33 66 132 198\n30 (60 Hz only) 27 55 110 165\n50 (50 Hz only) 33 66 99\n60 (60 Hz only) 27 55 82\n\n\n\nN.16\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nSynchrophasors\nSynchrophasor Relay Word Bits\n\nat any message rate (MRATE) when SPEED = 38400 or 57600, as much as \nMRATE = 50 or 30 when SPEED = 19200, or MRATE = 25 or 20 when \nSPEED = 9600.\n\nAnother example application has messages consisting of ten synchrophasors \nand one digital status word. This type of message would consume between 64 \nand 108 bytes, depending on the numeric format settings. The 64-byte version, \nusing integer numeric representation, could be sent at any message rate \n(MRATE) when SPEED = 57600. The 108-byte version, using floating-point \nnumeric representation, could be sent as much as MRATE = 25 or 30 when \nSPEED = 57600, MRATE = 20 or 25 when SPEED = 38400, and \nMRATE = 10 or 12 when SPEED = 19200.\n\nProtocol Operation The SEL-311C will only transmit synchrophasor messages over serial ports \nthat have setting PROTO = PMU. The connected device will typically be a \nsynchrophasor processor, such as the SEL-3378 Synchrophasor Vector \nProcessor. The synchrophasor processor controls the PMU functions of the \nSEL-311C, with IEEE C37.118 commands, including commands to start and \nstop synchrophasor data transmission, and commands to request a \nconfiguration block from the relay, so the synchrophasor processor can \nautomatically build a database structure.\n\nTransmit Mode Control\nThe SEL-311C will not begin transmitting synchrophasors until an enable \nmessage is received from the synchrophasor processor. The relay will stop \nsynchrophasor transmission when the appropriate command is received from \nthe synchrophasor processor. The SEL-311C can also indicate when a \nconfiguration change occurs, so the synchrophasor processor can request a \nnew configuration block and keep its database up-to-date.\n\nThe SEL-311C will only respond to configuration block request messages \nwhen it is in the non-transmitting mode.\n\nIndependent Ports\nEach serial port with the PROTO = PMU setting is independently configured \nand enabled for synchrophasor commands. The ports are not required to have \nthe same SPEED setting, although the slowest SPEED setting on a \nPROTO = PMU port will affect the maximum Global MRATE setting that can \nbe used.\n\nSynchrophasor Relay Word Bits\nTable N.9 and Table N.10 list the SEL-311C Relay Word bits that are related \nto synchrophasor measurement.\n\nThe Synchrophasor Trigger Relay Word bits in Table N.9 follow the state of \nthe SELOGIC control equations of the same name, listed in Table N.2.

See \nConfiguring High-Accuracy Timekeeping on page N.27. \n\nView Synchrophasors by Using the MET PM \nCommand\n\nThe MET PM serial port ASCII command may be used to view the \nSEL-311C synchrophasor measurements. See MET Command (Metering \nData) on page 10.51 for general information on the MET command.\nThere are multiple ways to use the MET PM command:\n\n➤ As a test tool, to verify connections, phase rotation, and scaling\n\n➤ As an analytical tool, to capture synchrophasor data at an exact \ntime, in order to compare this information with similar data \ncaptured in other phasor measurement unit(s) at the same time.\n\n➤ As a method of periodically gathering synchrophasor data \nthrough a communications processor.\n\nThe MET PM command displays the same set of analog synchrophasor \ninformation, regardless of the Global settings MFRMT, PHDATAV and \nPHDATAI. The MET PM command can function even when no ports are \nsending synchrophasor data.\n\nThe MET PM command only displays data when the Relay Word bit TSOK = \nlogical 1. Figure N.8 shows a sample MET PM command response. The \nsynchrophasor data are also available in the ACSELERATOR QuickSet HMI \nand have a similar format to Figure N.8.\n\nTREA3 Trigger Reason Bit 3 (SELOGIC control equation)\nTREA2 Trigger Reason Bit 2 (SELOGIC control equation)\nTREA1 Trigger Reason Bit 1 (SELOGIC control equation)\n\nTable N.10 Time-Synchronization Relay Word Bits\n\nName Description\n\nTIRIG Asserts while relay time is based on IRIG-B time source.\n\nTSOK Time synchronization OK.

A few seconds may be required for \nPMDOK to assert when the relay is first powered, after any of the set-\ntings in Table N.1 are changed, or when an IRIG-B time signal is first \nconnected.\n\nTable N.9 Synchrophasor Trigger Relay Word Bits (Sheet 2 of 2)\n\nName Description\n\n\n\nN.18\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nSynchrophasors\nIEEE C37.118 PMU Setting Example\n\nThe MET PM time command can be used to direct the SEL-311C to display \nthe synchrophasor for an exact specified time, in 24-hour format. For example, \nentering the command MET PM 14:14:12 will result in a response similar to \nFigure N.8 occurring just after 14:14:12, with the time stamp 14:14:12.000.\nThis method of data capture always reports from the exact second, even if the \ntime parameter is entered with fractional seconds. For example, entering MET \nPM 14:14:12.200 results in the same data capture as MET PM 14:14:12, \nbecause the relay ignored the fractional seconds.\n\nSee MET PM—Synchrophasor Metering on page 10.55 for complete \ncommand options, and error messages.\n\nMET PM HIS recalls the most recently triggered synchrophasor meter report. \nThis is useful when synchrophasor data from multiple relays must be captured \non a single PC. For example, connect to each relay and issue the MET PM \n14:14:00 command. At 14:14, each relay will issue a response similar to \nFigure N.8. After 14:14, connect to each relay, issue the MET PM HIS \ncommand, and capture the results. Because MET PM HIS recalls the last \nMET PM report, the data captured from every relay will be from the same \ntime.\n\n=>MET PM <Enter>\n\nSEL-311 Date: 12/01/08    Time: 10:33:59.000\nSTATION A\n\n                                                                  PMDOK = 1\nTime Quality   Maximum time synchronization error:     0.000 (ms)  TSOK = 1\n\nSynchrophasors\n                   Phase Voltages           Synch Voltage    Pos.-Seq.

The SEL Fast Message synchrophasor protocol always \nincludes the frequency information in floating-point representation, and \nfourteen user-programmable SELOGIC control equation variables SV3–SV16.\n\nCommunications \nBandwidth for Fast \nMessage Protocol\n\nA phasor measurement unit (PMU) that is configured to transmit a single \nsynchrophasor quantity (positive-sequence voltage, for example) at a message \nperiod of one second places little burden on the communications channel. As \nmore synchrophasors or interleaved protocols are added, some \ncommunications channel restrictions come into play.\n\nThe SPEED setting on any serial port set with PROTO = SEL should be set as \nhigh as possible to allow for the largest possible number of message period \nrequests to be successful.\n\nThe SEL-311C Fast Message synchrophasor format always includes 32 bytes \nfor the message header and terminal ID, time information, frequency, and \nstatus bits. The selection of synchrophasor data will add to the byte \nrequirements. Each synchrophasor quantity will add eight bytes to the \nmessage length. Table N.21 shows the effect that adding synchrophasor \nquantities has on the minimum allowed SPEED setting.\n\nThe number of interleaved protocols sharing the same physical port will also \nimpact the minimum allowed SPEED setting. Table N.21 shows the setting if \nthe Fast Message Synchrophasor format is the only data stream transmitted; \nadditional data streams will necessitate a higher SPEED setting.\n\nTable N.21 SEL Fast Message Voltage and Current Selections Based on PHDATAV and PHDATAI\n\nGlobal Settings\n\nNumber of \nSynchrophasor \nMagnitude and \n\nAngle Pairs \nTransmitted\n\nSynchrophasor Magnitude and \nAngle Pairs to Transmit, and \n\nthe Transmit Order\n\nSynchrophasor \nData Size (Bytes)\n\nMinimum Baud \nRate (SPEED \n\nSetting) at One \nSecond \n\nMessage Period\n\nPHDATAV = V1\nPHDATAI = NA\n\n1 V1 40 1200 Baud\n\nPHDATAV = ALL\nPHDATAI = NA\n\n4 VA, VB, VC, V1 64 2400 Baud\n\nPHDATAV = ALL\nPHDATAI = ALL\n\n8 VA, VB, VC, V1, IA, IB, IC, I1 96 4800 Baud\n\n\n\nN.27\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nSynchrophasors\nConfiguring High-Accuracy Timekeeping\n\nIndependent Ports Each serial port with the PROTO = SEL setting is independently configured \nand enabled for synchrophasor commands. For example, if there are two serial \nports set to PROTO = SEL, the status of one port has no effect on the other \nport. One port might be commanded to start transmitting synchrophasor \nmessages, while the other port is idle, responding to a configuration block or \nFast Operate request, or transmitting synchrophasors. The ports are not \nrequired to have the same SPEED setting, although the SPEED setting on each \nPROTO = SEL port will affect the minimum synchrophasor message data \nperiod that can be used on that port.\n\nConfiguring High-Accuracy Timekeeping\nThe SEL-311C features high-accuracy timekeeping when supplied with an \nIRIG-B signal. When the supplied clock signal is sufficiently accurate, the \nSEL-311C can act as a Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) and transmit \nsynchrophasor data representative of the power system at fixed time periods to \nan external data processor. The relay can also record event report data using \nthe high-accuracy time stamp (see Synchrophasor-Level Accuracy in Event \nReports on page 12.15).\n\nIRIG-B IRIG Standard 200-04 defines many different types of time code formats. \nIRIG-B002, or “standard IRIG-B” provides time data once per second. The \ntime data are formatted as second of the minute, minute of the hour, hour of \nthe day, and day of the year. IRIG-B000, or extended IRIG-B, adds control \nfunctions that are defined based on the application. In this manual, IRIG-B000 \nis used to identify a time signal containing the control functions defined by \nIEEE C37.118 Standard for Synchrophasors for Power Systems. These \ncontrol functions include the year, leap second, and daylight saving time \ninformation, UTC offset, time quality indicator codes, and a parity bit.\n\nIn a standard shipment, the SEL-311C has two input connectors that accept \nIRIG-B demodulated time-code format: the IRIG-B pins of Serial Port 2, and \nthe IRIG-B BNC connector. The optional SEL-2812 compatible fiber port can \nalso provide an IRIG-B signal if connected to a fiber-optic transceiver that \ntransmits IRIG-B or the fiber-optic port of an SEL-2407 clock.\n\nThe BNC and Port 2 connections can be used for high-accuracy timekeeping \npurposes, with as much as 1 µs accuracy with an appropriate time source. Any \nof the three inputs can be used for general-purpose timekeeping, and the relay \nwill have as much as 5 ms accuracy. The SEL-2812-compatible fiber-optic \nport is not suitable for high-accuracy timekeeping. See Table N.22 for \nSEL-311C timekeeping mode details.\n\nTable N.22 SEL-311C Timekeeping Modes\n\nItem Internal Clock Normal Accuracy IRIG Holdover High-Accuracy IRIG\n\nBest accuracy \n(condition)\n\nDepends on last \nmethod of setting, plus \ninternal clock drifta\n\na The SEL-311C internal clock can be synchronized via SNTP, DNP3, SEL-2030 Communications Processor, or ASCII TIM command.\n\n5 ms (when IRIG-B signal not \nmeeting requirements for high-\naccuracy IRIG is connected)\n\n1 µs (when time source \njitter is less than 500 ns, and \ntime error is less than 1 µs)b\n\nb The time error check only applies when Global setting IRIGC = C37.118.\n\nIRIG-B Connection \nRequired\n\nNone BNC connector (preferred), \nSerial Port 2, or fiber-optic \nSerial Port 1\n\nBNC connector (preferred) \nor Serial Port 2\n\nRelay Word bits TIRIG = logical 0\nTSOK = logical 0\n\nTIRIG = logical 1\nTSOK = logical 0\n\nTIRIG = logical 0\nTSOK = logical 1\n\nTIRIG = logical 1\nTSOK = logical 1\n\n\n\nN.28\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nSynchrophasors\nConfiguring High-Accuracy Timekeeping\n\nOnly one IRIG-B time source can be used by the SEL-311C. The relay uses \nIRIG-B signals from the three sources with the following priority.\n\n1. BNC input\n\n2. Serial Port 2 IRIG-B pins\n\n3. SEL-2812 compatible fiber-optic Port 1 (if present)\nThe SEL-311C determines the suitability of the IRIG-B signal for Normal \nAccuracy IRIG by applying several tests.\n\n➤ Seconds, minutes, and day field are in range\n\n➤ Time from two consecutive messages differ by 1 second, \nexcept for leap second or daylight saving time transitions.\n\n➤ When IRIGC = C37.118, the signal contains the correct parity bit.\n\nThe SEL-311C determines the suitability of the IRIG-B signal for high-\naccuracy timekeeping by applying two additional tests.\n\n➤ The jitter between positive-transitions (rising edges) of the \nclock signal is less than 500 ns.\n\n➤ The time-error information contained in the IRIG-B control \nfield indicates time error is less than 10-6 seconds (1 µs). \n\nWhen IRIGC = C37.118 and an appropriate IRIG-B signal is connected, the \nSEL-311C will assert Relay Word bit TSOK only when these two tests are \nmet. When IRIGC = NONE, the relay will assert TSOK when only the first \ntest is met. \n\nThe relay accepts C37.118 (IRIG-B000) signals with either odd or even parity. \nWhen an IRIG-B signal is connected, the relay detects whether the signal has \nodd or even parity and continues to check received IRIG-B messages for that \nparity. If a message is received with the opposite parity or no parity, the signal \nfails the parity test.\n\nIf your clock has programmable parity and the parity is changed, the relay \ndisqualifies the IRIG-B signal for a few seconds until it detects that the parity \nchange is not because of corrupt messages.\n\nIf the relay is in High Accuracy mode and any of the tests fail, the relay enters \nHoldover mode. When in Holdover, the relay asserts TSOK, deasserts TIRIG, \nand holds Relay Word bits TQUAL1, TQUAL2, TQUAL3, and TQUAL4 at \ntheir last state. The relay remains in Holdover mode for as long as 15 seconds \nand reverts to High Accuracy IRIG, Normal Accuracy IRIG, or internal clock, \ndepending on conditions.\n\nIf you connect two IRIG-B sources, they should be of the same format \n(IRIG-B000 with C37.118 control extensions or IRIG-B002) and match the \nIRIGC setting. SEL does not recommend connecting different types of signals \nto different inputs (for example, an IRIG-B000 signal to the BNC input and an \nIRIG-B002 signal to Port 1 or Port 2) when IRIGC = C37.118. The \nIRIG-B002 signal provides neither the year nor the parity bit required for \nNormal Accuracy mode when IRIGC = C37.118. In this case, if the \nIRIG-B000 source fails, relay timekeeping reverts to the internal clock, but the \nrelay year changes to 2000 and remains incorrect until the IRIG-B000 signal \nreturns. The relay will update the time from the IRIG-B002 signal about once \nevery 10 seconds if the signal passes the remaining two tests for Normal \nAccuracy mode. Relay Word bit TIRIG asserts momentarily during the \nupdate.\n\nNOTE: If the time-code signal \nconnected to a higher priority source \ndegrades in quality, the SEL-311C will \nnot switch over to a lower priority \nsource. The SEL-311C will only switch \nto Serial Port 2 or fiber-optic Serial \nPort 1 if the signal on the higher \npriority source completely fails (e.g., \nthe cable is unplugged). Use the TIME Q \ncommand to determine which IRIG-B \nsource is in use.\n\n\n\nN.29\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nSynchrophasors\nConfiguring High-Accuracy Timekeeping\n\nA time quality value is determined based on the four-bit Time Quality \nindicator code defined in the IEEE C37.118 standard. When Global setting \nIRIGC = C37.118, the raw time quality information from the IRIG-B signal is \nplaced into four Relay Word bits TQUAL1, TQUAL2, TQUAL3, and \nTQUAL4. For example, if TQAUL1 = 1, TQUAL2 = 0, TQUAL3 = 1, and \nTQUAL4 = 0, the binary time quality indicator code received from the clock \nvia the IRIG signal is 0101, which corresponds to 10 microseconds time error. \nSee Table N.24 for time quality decoding. The time quality is shown in the \nMET PM report beside the label Time Quality   Maximum time \nsynchronization error: viewed with the MET PM command. \n\nWhen IRIGC = C37.118, the relay also decodes Leap Second Pending, Leap \nSecond Direction, Daylight Savings Pending, and Daylight Savings control \nbits that are present in the IRIG-B signal. The status of these control bits is \nreflected in Relay Word bits LPSECP, LPSEC, DSTP, and DST, respectively.\n\nWhen IRIGC = NONE, the TQUAL1, TQUAL2, TQUAL3, TQUAL4, \nLPSECP, LPSEC, DSTP, and DST Relay Word bits are not updated. When \nGlobal setting MFRMT = C37.118, IRIGC is forced to C37.118.\n\nConnecting \nHigh-Accuracy \nTimekeeping\n\nThe procedure in the following steps assumes that you have a modern high-\naccuracy GPS receiver with a BNC connector output for an IRIG-B signal. \nUse a communications terminal to send commands and receive data from the \nrelay.\n\nThis example assumes that you have successfully established communication \nwith the relay.

The TIRIG and TSOK Relay Word bits should be \nasserted (logical 1), indicating that the relay is in the \nhigh-accuracy IRIG timekeeping mode. \n\nIf TSOK is not asserted, but TIRIG is asserted, the relay is in \nregular IRIG timekeeping mode. Here is a list of possible \nreasons for not entering high-accuracy mode:\n➣ Global setting IRIGC = C37.118, but the IRIG-B clock \n\ndoes not use the IEEE C37.118 Control Bit assignments.\n➣ The IRIG-B signal jitter is too high.\n➣ The termination resistor, required by some IRIG clocks, is \n\nnot installed.\n➣ Global setting IRIGC = C37.118, but the time-source \n\nclock is reporting that its time error is greater than 1 µs.\n\nIf neither TSOK nor TIRIG are asserted, the relay is not in an \nIRIG time-source mode. Here is a list of possible reasons for \nnot entering IRIG mode:\n➣ The IRIG-B clock signal is not of sufficient accuracy or is \n\nimproperly configured.\n➣ The termination resistor, required by some IRIG clocks, is \n\nnot installed.\n➣ The time source clock is not connected to an antenna.\n\n\n\nN.31\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nSynchrophasors\nSynchrophasor Protocols and SEL Fast Operate Commands\n\nSynchrophasor Protocols and SEL Fast Operate \nCommands \n\nThe SEL-311C can be configured to process SEL Fast Operate commands \nreceived on serial ports that have Port setting PROTO = PMU, when the Port \nsetting FASTOP = Y.\n\nThis functionality can allow a host device to initiate control actions in the \nPMU without the need for a separate communications interface.\n\nIf port setting FASTOP= Y on a serial port set to PROTO = PMU, the \nSEL-311C will provide Fast Operate support. The host device can request a \nFast Operate Configuration Block when the relay is in the nontransmitting \nmode, and the relay will respond with the message, which includes codes that \ndefine the circuit breaker and remote bit control points that are available via \nFast Operate commands. \n\nThe SEL-311C will process Fast Operate requests regardless of whether \nsynchrophasors are being transmitted, as long as serial port setting \nFASTOP = Y. When FASTOP = N, the relay will ignore Fast Operate \ncommands. Use the FASTOP = N option to lockout any control actions from \nthat serial port if required by your company operating practices.\n\nThe SEL-311C does not acknowledge received Fast Operate commands. \nHowever, it is easy to program one or more Relay Word bits to observe the \ncontrolled function. For example, a Fast Operate Circuit Breaker close \ncommand could be confirmed by monitoring the breaker status bit 52A by \nassigning SELOGIC control equation setting LV32 = 52A.\n\nNote that only the Fast Operate function is available on ports set to PROTO = \nPMU. The protocols SEL Fast Meter and SEL Fast SER are unavailable on \nPROTO = PMU ports.\n\n\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nAppendix O\nModbus RTU and TCP Communications\n\nR.Instruction Manual\n\nOverview\nThis appendix describes Modbus® RTU and TCP communications features \nsupported by the SEL-311C Protection System. Complete specifications for \nthe Modbus protocol are available from the Modbus user’s group website at \nwww.modbus.org.\n\nThe SEL-311C allows as many as three simultaneous Modbus sessions. The \nnumber of Ethernet Modbus sessions is limited by the number of enabled \nEthernet DNP sessions. See Session Limits on page 10.15.\n\nThe SEL-311C Modbus communication allows a Modbus master device to do \nthe following:\n\n➤ Acquire metering, monitoring, and event data from the relay.\n\n➤ Control SEL-311C output contacts and remote bits.\n\n➤ Read and switch the Active Setting Group.\n\n➤ Read and set the time and date.\n\n➤ Reset targets, demand and peak data, energy data, breaker \nmonitor, min/max, and event history data.\n\nEnable Modbus TCP protocol with the Ethernet port setting EMODBUS. The \nmaster IP address for each session is selected with the Ethernet port settings \nMODIP1, MODIP2, and MODIP3. The Master IP address 0.0.0.0 is a valid \nentry and is used to accept a connection from any master. Use caution when \nusing this address as any Modbus master may connect to the Ethernet port \nthrough this connection. When a Modbus TCP master attempts to connect, the \nrelay will first search the valid master IP addresses. If no matching Modbus \nmaster IP address is found, and one of the MODIPx addresses is 0.0.0.0, the \nmaster will be allowed to connect through that connection. The TCP port \nnumber is the Modbus TCP registered port 502. Modbus TCP uses the device \nIP address as the Modbus identifier and accesses the data in the relay using the \nsame function codes and data maps as Modbus RTU.\n\nModbus RTU is a binary protocol that permits communication between a \nsingle master device and multiple slave devices. The communication is half \nduplex—only one device transmits at a time. The master transmits a binary \ncommand that includes the address of the desired slave device. All of the slave \ndevices receive the message, but only the slave device with the matching \naddress responds. Enable Modbus RTU protocol with the serial port PROTO \nsetting.\n\n\n\nO.2\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nModbus RTU and TCP Communications\nCommunications Protocol\n\nCommunications Protocol\nModbus RTU Queries Modbus master devices initiate all exchanges by sending a query. The query \n\nformat for Modbus RTU consists of the fields shown in Table O.1.\n\nThe SEL-311C serial port SLAVEID setting defines the device address. Set \nthis value to a unique number for each device on the Modbus network. For \nModbus RTU communication to operate properly, no two slave devices may \nhave the same address.\n\nThe cyclic redundancy check detects errors in the received data. If an error is \ndetected, the relay discards the packet.\n\nModbus TCP Queries The Modbus request or response is encapsulated when carried on a Modbus \nTCP/IP network. A dedicated header used on TCP/IP identifies the Modbus \nApplication Data Unit (ADU). The header, called the MBAP (Modbus \nApplication Protocol header), contains the following fields:\n\nThe Modbus TCP Message consists of the MBAP Header, followed by the \nModbus function code and the data supporting the function code. The Modbus \nTCP message does not contain the 2 byte CRC that is included in the RTU \nmessage, as the error checking is accomplished through TCP. Otherwise the \ndata following the MBAP header is identical to the Modbus RTU message.\n\nThe remainder of this section will cover the Modbus Function codes in terms \nof the Modbus RTU protocol. \n\nModbus Responses The slave device sends a response message after it performs the action the \nquery specifies. If the slave cannot execute the query command for any reason, \nit sends an error response. Otherwise, the slave device response is formatted \nsimilarly to the query and includes the slave address, function code, data (if \napplicable), and a cyclic redundancy check value.\n\nTable O.1 Modbus Query Fields\n\nField Number of Bytes\n\nSlave Device Address 1 byte\n\nFunction Code 1 byte\n\nData Region 0–251 bytes\n\nCyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) 2 bytes\n\nField Number of Bytes\n\nTransaction Identifier 2 Bytes\n\nProtocol Identifier 2 Bytes (0 = MODBUS protocol)\nLength 2 Bytes\n\nUnit Identifier 1 Byte\n\n\n\nO.3\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nModbus RTU and TCP Communications\nCommunications Protocol\n\nSupported Modbus \nFunction Codes\n\nThe SEL-311C supports the Modbus function codes shown in Table O.2.\n\nModbus Exception \nResponses\n\nThe SEL-311C sends an exception code under the conditions described in \nTable O.3.\n\nIn the event that any of the errors listed in Table O.3 occur, the relay assembles \na response message that includes the exception code in the data field. The \nrelay sets the most significant bit in the function code field to indicate to the \nmaster that the data field contains an error code, instead of the required data.\n\nCyclic Redundancy \nCheck\n\nThe SEL-311C calculates a 2-byte CRC value through use of the device \naddress, function code, and data region. It appends this value to the end of \nevery Modbus RTU response. When the master device receives the response, \nit recalculates the CRC. If the calculated CRC matches the CRC sent by the \nSEL-311C, the master device uses the data received. If there is no match, the \ncheck fails and the message is ignored. The devices use a similar process \nwhen the master sends queries.\n\nTable O.2 SEL-311C Modbus Function Codes\n\nCodes Description\n\n01h Read Discrete Output Coil Status\n\n02h Read Discrete Input Status\n\n03h Read Holding Registers\n\n04h Read Input Registers\n\n05h Force Single Coil\n\n06h Preset Single Register\n\n08h Diagnostic Command\n\n10h Preset Multiple Registers\n\nTable O.3 SEL-311C Modbus Exception Codes\n\nException \nCode\n\nError Type Description\n\n1 Illegal Function \nCode\n\nThe received function code is either undefined or \nunsupported.\n\n2 Illegal Data \nAddress\n\nThe received command contains an \nunsupported address in the data field.\n\n3 Illegal Data Value The received command contains a value that is out of \nrange.\n\n4 Device Error The SEL-311C is in the wrong state for the function a \nquery specifies.\nThe relay is unable to perform the action specified by \na query (i.e., cannot write to a read-only register, \ndevice is disabled, etc.).\n\n6 Busy The device is unable to process the command at this \ntime because of a busy resource.\n\n\n\nO.4\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nModbus RTU and TCP Communications\nFunction Codes\n\nFunction Codes\n01h Read Discrete \nOutput Coil Status \nCommand\n\nUse function code 01h to read the On/Off status of the selected bits (coils) (see \nthe Output Coils table shown in Table O.14).

This feature \nallows you to take 250 discrete values from anywhere in the Modbus \nQuantities Table (Table O.22) and place them in contiguous registers that you \ncan then read in a single command. Use the SEL ASCII command SET M (or \nthe Modbus User Map settings in ACSELERATOR QuickSet® SEL-5030 \nSoftware) to define the user map addresses. A default map is provided with \nthe relay. If the default Modbus map is not appropriate or more data are \ndesired, edit the map as required for your application.\n\nTo use the user-defined data region, follow the steps listed below.\n\nStep 1. Define the list of desired quantities (as many as 250). Arrange \nthe quantities in any order that is convenient for you to use.\n\nStep 2. Refer to Table O.22 for a list of the Modbus labels for each \nquantity.\n\nStep 3. Use the SET M command from the command line or \nACSELERATOR QuickSet Modbus User Map to map user \nregisters 001 to 250 (MOD_001 to MOD_250) using the labels \nin Table O.22.\n\nStep 4. Use Modbus function code 03h or 04h to read the desired \nquantities from addresses 0 through 249 (decimal).\nNote that the Modbus addresses begin with zero, which \ncorresponds to Set M setting MOD_001.\n\nAs each label is entered in a register via the SET M command, the relay will \nincrement to the next valid register.\n\nIf a label is entered for a 32-bit quantity register (e.g., VA, VB, VC, KW3), the \nrelay will automatically skip a register in the sequence because two registers \nare required for the 32-bit quantity. The register with the lower index is the \nmost significant word and the register with the higher index is the least \nsignificant word in the 32-bit quantity. In the following example, MOD_015 \nwas previously set to 3I2, which is a 16 bit value and consumes one register. \nBy changing the register label to KW3, a 32 bit value, the next register shown \navailable for setting is MOD_017.\n\n=>>SET M MOD_015 <Enter>\n\nModbus Map, Section 1:\nUSER REG#015\nMOD_015 = 3I2\n     ? KW3\n\nUSER REG#017\nMOD_017 = VA\n     ?\n\nUSER REG#019\nMOD_019 = VAFA\n     ?\n=>>\n\nSimilarly, in this example, MOD_017 was previously set to VA, which is a 32 \nbit value and consumes two registers. By changing the register label to IA, a \n16 bit value, the next register shown available for setting is MOD_018. \nBecause MOD_018 was previously not available, as it was the second register \nused for MOD_017 (VA), there is no label assigned to it and shows NA.\n\nNOTE: If your master uses 5- or \n6-digit address references, add the \nappropriate number to the Modbus \nAddress provided in Table O.23 when \nconfiguring your master. For example, \nif your master uses 5-digit addressing, \nadd 40001 for holding register \noperations. For input register \nfunctions, add 30001. \n\nIf your master uses 6-digit addressing, \nadd 400001 for holding register \noperations or 300001 for input \nregister functions.\n\nThe actual address that appears in the \naddress field of the message will be \nthe Modbus Address shown in \nTable O.23. For example, MOD_001 is \naddress 0000 (see Table O.23 for \nModbus register addresses). A master \nusing 6-digit addresses to read a \nholding register may be configured for \naddress 400001. However, the data \naddress field of the message from the \nmaster will contain address 0000.\n\n\n\nO.19\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nModbus RTU and TCP Communications\nModbus Documentation\n\n=>>SET M MOD_017 <Enter>\n\nModbus Map, Section 1:\nUSER REG#017\nMOD_017 = VA\n     ?

The Event History registers are listed in Table O.22 \nunder the Historical Data description heading. To read the history data, set the \nModbus Map to contain the EVESEL label, along with the other Fault History \nrelated labels. The following example shows some of the available history \ndata labels in the Modbus Map:\n\n=>>SHO M <Enter>\n\nMOD_001 = NUMEVE   \nMOD_002 = EVESEL   \nMOD_003 = FTIME_S  \nMOD_004 = FTIME_M\nMOD_005 = FTIME_H  \nMOD_006 = FDATE_D  \nMOD_007 = FDATE_M  \nMOD_008 = FDATE_Y\nMOD_009 = FLOC     \nMOD_010 = FI       \nMOD_011 = FIA      \nMOD_012 = FIB\nMOD_013 = FIC      \nMOD_014 = FIG      \nMOD_015 = FIN      \nMOD_016 = FFREQ\nMOD_017 = FGRP     \nMOD_018 = FSHO     \nMOD_019 = EVE_TYPE\n\nUse Modbus function code 03 or 04 to read the Modbus registers. The \nNUMEVE label will contain the number of events listed in the event history, \nHIS command, and response. To read relay event history data using Modbus, \nuse function code 06 to write the event number to the Modbus register \ncontaining the EVESEL label. The SEL-311C will populate the other event \nrelated registers with the data related to the event number specified in the \nEVESEL label address. Issue a Modbus function code 03 or 04 command to \nread the registers containing the history data.\n\nFor example, use the following relay response to the HIS command:\n\n=>>HIS <Enter>\nSEL-311                           Date: 06/05/01    Time: 13:32:54.127\nSTATION A\n\n# DATE     TIME         EVENT    LOCAT    CURR   FREQ  GRP SHOT   TARGETS\n1 06/05/13 04:14:19.950 ABC T   64.93     2144   60.00    1       ZONE 1\n2 12/06/13 08:31:50.978 ABG T   94.95     9983   60.00    1       INST SOTF 50 51 81\n3 02/13/14 12:25:44.449 PULSE   26.92     1830   60.00    2       TRIP SOTF\n4 06/22/14 07:18:19.088 AG T     9.65     2279   60.00    3       TIME 51\n\nRetrieve the history data in this example for event number 4, using the map \nshown above, by setting register address 0001 to the value of 4 using a \nfunction code 06 command. (Note: The Modbus Map is indexed beginning \nwith 1, which corresponds to register address 0 in Modbus). If a value is \nwritten to the EVESEL register for an event that does not currently exist in the \nhistory data, the SEL-311C will respond with an exception code 03.\n\nFollowing the function code 06 command, issue a function code 03 or 04 \ncommand to read registers 0–18. The data returned in registers 2–18 would \ncontain the event time, event date, fault location, maximum fault current, fault \ncurrent per phase, ground fault current, neutral fault current, the frequency, \nsettings group, number of shots, and event type associated with event \nnumber 4.\n\na Register labels appearing in bold are 32-bit quantities and consume two registers.\nb Modbus Addresses 1001–1032 contain string data. Strings are packed 2 characters per register, \n\nwith the most significant bit containing the character closest to the beginning of the string.\n\n\n\nO.32\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nModbus RTU and TCP Communications\nModbus Documentation\n\nThe HIS E command returns the same history data, but uses a unique event \nnumber in the range 10000 to 65535. The relay will also return the history \ndata if the unique event number is written to the EVESEL register as long as \nthat event is currently in the history data.\n\n=>>HIS E <Enter>\nSEL-311                           Date: 06/05/01    Time: 13:36:29.192\nSTATION A\n\n#     DATE     TIME          EVENT  LOCAT  CURR   FREQ   GRP SHOT  TARGETS\n10007 06/05/13 04:14:19.950  ABC T  64.93  2144   60.00   1       ZONE 1\n10006 12/06/13 08:31:50.978  ABG T  94.95  9983   60.00   1       INST SOTF 50 51 81\n10005 02/13/14 12:25:44.449  PULSE  26.92  1830   60.00   2       TRIP SOTF\n10004 06/22/14 07:18:19.088  AG T    9.65  2279   60.00   3       TIME 51\n\nWhen the history data is cleared in the relay, either from the HIS C command \nor from a remote control point, the NUMEVE register will contain the value \nof 0, indicating there are no events that can be read using Modbus. The \nModbus fault data registers may contain data from a past event, until a new \nvalid event number is written to the EVESEL register.\n\n\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nDate _______________ 1 of 8Modbus Settings Sheets\nModbus Map Settings (SET M Command)\n\nModbus Settings Sheets\nInstruction Manual\n\nModbus Map Settings (SET M Command)\nModbus User Map\n\nSee Table O.22 for list of valid labels.\n\nNOTE: 32-bit values, such as VA, VB, and VC consume two registers.

(IEEE) began to define a \nUtility Communications Architecture (UCA). They initially focused on \ninter-control center and substation-to-control center communications and \nproduced the Inter-Control Center Communications Protocol (ICCP) \nspecification. This specification, later adopted by the IEC as 60870-6 TASE.2, \nbecame the standard protocol for real-time exchange of data between \ndatabases.\n\nIn 1994, EPRI and IEEE began work on UCA 2.0 for Field Devices (simply \nreferred to as UCA2). In 1997, they combined efforts with Technical \nCommittee 57 of the IEC to create a common international standard. Their \njoint efforts created the current IEC 61850 standard.\nThe IEC 61850 standard, a superset of UCA2, contains most of the UCA2 \nspecification, plus additional functionality. The standard describes \nclient/server and peer-to-peer communications, substation design and \nconfiguration, testing, and project standards.\nThe IEC 61850 standard consists of the parts listed in Table P.1.\n\nThe IEC 61850 document set, available directly from the IEC at \nhttp://www.iec.ch, contains information necessary for successful \nimplementation of this protocol. SEL strongly recommends that anyone \ninvolved with the design, installation, configuration, or maintenance of \nIEC 61850 systems be familiar with the appropriate sections of this standard.\n\nTable P.1 IEC 61850 Document Set\n\nIEC 61850 Sections Definitions\n\nIEC 61850-1 Introduction and overview\n\nIEC 61850-2 Glossary\n\nIEC 61850-3 General requirements\n\nIEC 61850-4 System and project management\nIEC 61850-5 Communication requirements\n\nIEC 61850-6 Configuration description language for substation IEDs\n\nIEC 61850-7-1 Basic communication structure for substations and feeder \nequipment—Principles and models\n\nIEC 61850-7-2 Basic communication structure for substations and feeder \nequipment—Abstract communication service interface \n(ACSI)\n\nIEC 61850-7-3 Basic communication structure for substations and feeder \nequipment—Common data classes\n\nIEC 61850-7-4 Basic communication structure\nfor substations and feeder equipment—Compatible logical \nnode (LN) classes and data classes\n\nIEC 61850-8-1 SCSM—Mapping to Manufacturing Messaging Specification \n(MMS) (ISO/IEC 9506-1 and ISO/IEC 9506-2 over ISO/IEC \n8802-3)\n\nIEC 61850-9-1 SCSM—Sampled values over serial multidrop point-to-point \nlink \n\nIEC 61850-9-2 SCSM—Sampled values over ISO/IEC 8802-3\n\nIEC 61850-10 Conformance testing\n\n\n\nP.3\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nIEC 61850\nIEC 61850 Operation\n\nIEC 61850 Operation\nEthernet Networking IEC 61850 and Ethernet networking model options are available when \n\nordering a new SEL-311C and may also be available as field upgrades to \nrelays equipped with dual copper and dual or single fiber-optic Ethernet. In \naddition to IEC 61850, the relay provides support protocols and data \nexchange, including FTP and Telnet. Access the SEL-311C Port 5 settings to \nconfigure all of the Ethernet settings, including IEC 61850 enable settings.\n\nThe SEL-311C supports IEC 61850 services, including transport of Logical \nNode objects, over TCP/IP. The relay can coordinate a maximum of six \nconcurrent IEC 61850 sessions.\n\nObject Models The IEC 61850 standard relies heavily on the Abstract Communication \nService Interface (ACSI) models to define a set of services and the responses \nto those services. In terms of network behavior, abstract modeling enables all \nIEDs to act identically. These abstract models are used to create objects (data \nitems) and services that exist independently of any underlying protocols. \nThese objects are in conformance with the common data class (CDC) \nspecification IEC 61850-7-3, which describes the type and structure of each \nelement within a logical node. CDCs for status, measurements, controllable \nanalogs and statuses, and settings all have unique CDC attributes. Each CDC \nattribute belongs to a set of functional constraints that groups the attributes \ninto specific categories such as status (ST), description (DC), and substituted \nvalue (SV). Functional constraints, CDCs, and CDC attributes are used as \nbuilding blocks for defining Logical Nodes.\n\nUCA2 used GOMSFE (Generic Object Models for Substation and Feeder \nEquipment) to present data from station IEDs as a series of objects called \nmodels or bricks. The IEC working group has incorporated GOMSFE \nconcepts into the standard, with some modifications to terminology; one \nchange was the renaming of bricks to logical nodes. Each logical node \nrepresents a group of data (controls, status, measurements, etc.) associated \nwith a particular function. For example, the MMXU logical node (polyphase \nmeasurement unit) contains measurement data and other points associated \nwith three-phase metering including voltages and currents. Each IED may \ncontain many functions such as protection, metering, and control. Multiple \nlogical nodes represent the functions in multifunction devices.\n\nLogical nodes can be organized into logical devices that are similar to \ndirectories on a computer disk. As represented in the IEC 61850 network, \neach physical device can contain many logical devices and each logical device \ncan contain many logical nodes. Many relays, meters, and other IEC 61850 \ndevices contain one primary logical device where all models are organized.\n\nIEC 61850 devices are capable of self-description. You do not need to refer to \nthe specifications for the logical nodes, measurements, and other components \nto request data from another IEC 61850 device. IEC 61850 clients can request \nand display a list and description of the data available in an IEC 61850 server \ndevice. This process is similar to the autoconfiguration process used within \nSEL communications processors (SEL-2032 and SEL-2030). Simply run an \nMMS browser to query devices on an IEC 61850 network and discover what \ndata are available. Self-description also permits extensions to both standard \nand custom data models. Instead of having to look up data in a profile stored \nin its database, an IEC 61850 client can simply query an IEC 61850 device \nand receive a description of all logical devices, logical nodes, and available \ndata.\n\n\n\nP.4\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nIEC 61850\nIEC 61850 Operation\n\nUnlike other Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) protocols \nthat present data as a list of addresses or indices, IEC 61850 presents data with \ndescriptors in a composite notation made up of components. Table P.2 shows \nhow the A-phase current expressed as METMMXU1$A$phsA$cVal is broken \ndown into its component parts. The Data Attribute is characterized (filtered) \nby a functional constraint (FC) property. The supported FCs are listed in \nTable P.3. The FC for the given example above is MX.\n\nData Mapping Device data are mapped to IEC 61850 Logical Nodes (LN) according to rules \ndefined by SEL. Refer to IEC 61850-5:2003(E) and IEC 61850-7-4:2003(E) \nfor the mandatory content and usage of these LNs. The SEL-311C logical \nnodes are grouped under Logical Devices for organization based on function. \nSee Table P.4 for descriptions of the Logical Devices in an SEL-311C. See \nLogical Nodes on page P.29 for a description of the LNs that make up these \nLogical Devices.\n\nMMS Manufacturing Messaging Specification (MMS) provides services for the \napplication-layer transfer of real-time data within a substation LAN. MMS \nwas developed as a network independent data exchange protocol for industrial \nnetworks in the 1980s and standardized as ISO 9506.\n\nIn theory, you can map IEC 61850 to any protocol. However, it can become \nunwieldy and quite complicated to map objects and services to a protocol that \nonly provides access to simple data points via registers or index numbers. \nMMS supports complex named objects and flexible services that enable \n\nTable P.2 Example IEC 61850 Descriptor Components\n\nComponent Description\n\nMETMMXU1 Logical Node Polyphase measurement unit\n\nA Data Object Phase-to-ground amperes\nphsA Sub-Data Object Phase A\ncVal Data Attribute Complex value\n\nTable P.3 Functional Constraints\n\nFC Description\n\nST Status information\n\nMX Measurements (analog values)\nCO Control\n\nCF Configuration\n\nDC Description\n\nEX Extended definition\n\nTable P.4 SEL-311C Logical Devices\n\nLogical Device Description\n\nANN Annunciator elements—alarms, status values\n\nCFG Configuration elements—datasets and report control blocks\n\nCON Control elements—remote bits\n\nMET Metering or Measurement elements—currents, voltages, power, etc.\n\nPRO Protection elements—protection functions and breaker control\n\n\n\nP.5\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nIEC 61850\nIEC 61850 Operation\n\nmapping to IEC 61850 in a straightforward manner. This was why the UCA \nusers group used MMS for UCA from the start, and why the IEC chose to \nkeep it for IEC 61850.\n\nEvent files and reports are also available through MMS. See File Transfer \nProtocol (FTP) and MMS File Transfer on page 10.24, Retrieving \nCOMTRADE Event Files on page 12.14, and Retrieving Event Reports Via \nEthernet File Transfer on page 12.17. \nIf MMS authentication is enabled, the device authenticates each MMS \nassociation by requiring the client to provide the password authentication \nparameter with a value that is equal to the 2AC password of the SEL-311C.\n\n➤ If the correct password authentication parameter is not \nreceived, the device returns a not authenticated error code.\n\n➤ If the correct password authentication parameter value is \nreceived, the device gives a successful association response. \n\nOnce an authenticated association is established, the device allows access to \nall supported MMS services for that association.\n\nGOOSE The Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) object within \nIEC 61850 is for high-speed control messaging. IEC 61850 GOOSE \nautomatically broadcasts messages containing status, controls, and measured \nvalues onto the network for use by other devices. IEC 61850 GOOSE sends \nthe message several times, increasing the likelihood that other devices receive \nthe messages. GOOSE message publication is a persistent function. Once \nGOOSE is enabled, the IED will continuously publish GOOSE messages until \nthey are disabled regardless of the contents. The publication process \ndescription indicates when and why the publication rate changes.\n\nIEC 61850 GOOSE objects can quickly and conveniently transfer status, \ncontrols, and measured values between peers on an IEC 61850 network. \nConfigure SEL devices to respond to GOOSE messages from other network \ndevices with ACSELERATOR Architect. Also, configure outgoing GOOSE \nmessages for SEL devices in ACSELERATOR Architect. See the \nACSELERATOR Architect instruction manual or online help for more \ninformation.\n\nEach IEC 61850 GOOSE sender includes a text identification string (GOOSE \nControl Block Reference), APP ID field, and an Ethernet multicast group \naddress, in each outgoing message. Some devices that receive GOOSE \nmessages use the text identification and multicast group to identify and filter \nincoming GOOSE messages. The SEL-311C uses only the APP ID and \nmulticast group to identify and filter incoming GOOSE messages.\n\nVirtual bits (VB001–VB128) are control inputs that you can map to GOOSE \nreceive messages using the ACSELERATOR Architect software. If you intend to \nuse any SEL-311C virtual bits for controls, you must create SELOGIC® control \nequations to define these operations.\n\nFile Services The Ethernet File System allows reading or writing data as files. The File \nSystem supports FTP and MMS File Transfer. The File System provides:\n\n➤ A means for the device to transfer data as files.\n\n➤ A hierarchical file structure for the device data.\n\n\n\nP.6\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nIEC 61850\nIEC 61850 Operation\n\nThe SEL-311C supports MMS File transfer with or without authentication. \nThe service is intended to support the following:\n\n➤ CID file download and upload\n\n➤ Event report retrieval (from the COMTRADE and EVENTS \ndirectories)\n\nMMS File Services are enabled or disabled via Port 5 settings, EMMSFS. \nPermissions for the 2AC level apply to MMS File Services requests. All files \nand directories that are available at the 2AC access level via any supported file \ntransfer mechanism (FTP, file read/write, etc.) are also available for transfer \nvia MMS File Services.\n\nSCL Files Substation Configuration Language (SCL) is an XML-based configuration \nlanguage used to support the exchange of database configuration data between \ndifferent tools, which may come from different manufacturers. There are four \ntypes of SCL files:\n\n➤ Intelligent Electronic Device (IED) Capability Description file \n(.ICD)\n\n➤ System Specification Description (.SSD) file\n➤ Substation Configuration Description file (.SCD)\n➤ Configured IED Description file (.CID)\n\nThe ICD file describes the capabilities of an IED, including information on \nLN and GOOSE support. The SSD file describes the single-line diagram of \nthe substation and the required LNs. The SCD file contains information on all \nIEDs, communications configuration data, and a substation description. The \nCID file, of which there may be several, describes a single instantiated IED \nwithin the project, and includes address information.\n\nDatasets Datasets are configured using ACSELERATOR Architect and contain data \nattributes which represent real data values within the SEL-311C device. See \nthe Logical Nodes section in this appendix for the logical node tables that list \nthe available data attributes for each logical node and the relay word bit \nmapping for these data attributes. The list of datasets in Figure P.1 are the \ndefaults for a SEL-311C device. Datasets BRDSet01 through BRDSet07 and \nURDSet01 through URDSet07 are preconfigured with common FCDAs to be \nused for reporting. These datasets can be configured to represent the desired \ndata to be monitored. Dataset GPDSet01 is a preconfigured example dataset \nused for the example GOOSE publication GPub01. \n\n\n\nP.7\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nIEC 61850\nIEC 61850 Operation\n\nFigure P.1 SEL-311C Datasets\n\nWithin ACSELERATOR Architect, IEC 61850 datasets have the following \npurposes:\n\n➤ GOOSE: You can use predefined or edited datasets, or create \nnew datasets for outgoing GOOSE transmission.\n\n➤ Reports: Fourteen predefined datasets (BRDSet01 through \nBRDSet07 and URDSet01 through URDSet07) correspond to \nthe default seven buffered and seven unbuffered reports. Note \nthat you cannot change the number (14) or type of reports \n(buffered or unbuffered) within ACSELERATOR Architect. \nHowever, you can alter the data attributes that a dataset \ncontains and so define what data an IEC 61850 client receives \nwith a report. \n\n➤ MMS: You can use predefined or edited datasets, or you can \ncreate new datasets to be monitored by MMS clients.\n\nReports The SEL-311C implements the IEC 61850 reporting service as part of its \nserver functionality. The reporting service includes the functionality necessary \nto configure, manage, and send IEC 61850 buffered and unbuffered reports as \nunsolicited reports, periodic integrity reports, or as the result of a general \ninterrogation. See the IEC 61850 Standard, Part 7-1, Section 6.4.3.3, Part 7-2, \nSection 14, and Part 8-1, Section 17 for more details on the IEC 61850 \nreporting service.\n\nA total of 14 predefined reports (7 buffered and 7 unbuffered) are supported. \nThe predefined reports and the datasets assigned to each report are shown in \nFigure P.2 and are available by default via IEC 61850. The number of reports \n(14), the dataset assigned to each report, and the type of reports (buffered or \nunbuffered) cannot be changed. However, by using ACSELERATOR Architect \nsoftware, you can reallocate data within each report dataset to present \ndifferent data attributes for each report beyond the predefined datasets.\n\nNOTE: Do not edit the dataset \nnames used in reports. Changing or \ndeleting any of those dataset names \nwill cause a failure in generating the \ncorresponding report.\n\n\n\nP.8\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nIEC 61850\nIEC 61850 Operation\n\nFigure P.2 SEL-311C Predefined Reports\n\nBuffered and unbuffered report control blocks are supported in the report \nmodel as defined in IEC 61850-8-1:2004(E). There are 14 report control \nblocks (7 buffered and 7 unbuffered).\nFor each buffered report control block (BRCB), there can be just one client \nassociation (i.e., only one client can be associated to a BRCB at any given \ntime). The client association occurs when the client enables the RptEna \nattribute of the BRCB. Once enabled, the associated client has exclusive \naccess to the BRCB until the connection is closed or the client disables the \nRptEna attribute. Once enabled, all unassociated clients have read only access \nto the BRCB and the associated client will be the only client that receives \nbuffered report data. The BRCB parameters are shown in Table P.5.\n\nTable P.5 Buffered Report Control Block Client Access (Sheet 1 of 2)\n\nRCB Attribute\nUser Changeable \n(Report Disabled)\n\nUser Changeable \n(Report Enabled)\n\nDefault Values\n\nRptId YES BRep01–BRep07\n\nRptEna YES YES FALSE\n\nDatSet YES BRDSet01–\nBRDSet07\n\nConfRev 1\n\nOptFlds YES 0111100100\n\nreserved\n\nsequence-number TRUE\n\nreport-time-stamp TRUE\n\nreason-for-\ninclusion\n\nTRUE\n\ndata-set-name TRUE\n\ndata-reference FALSE\n\nbuffer-overflow FALSE\n\nentryID TRUE\n\nconf-revision FALSE\n\nsegmentation\n\nBufTm YES 500\n\n\n\nP.9\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nIEC 61850\nIEC 61850 Operation\n\nOnce a BRCB has been enabled, a report buffer is established. The buffer is \nsized to contain 10 complete reports with a size hard coded in the SEL-311C \nICD file. However, in cases where the report dataset is smaller than the \nallowed maximum size, or when the encoded report does not include the entire \ndataset, as many as 200 reports may appear in the buffer. Reports are \nmaintained in the buffer regardless of having been sent. This allows the client \nto retrieve reports that have already been sent by writing an EntryID prior to \nthe current EntryID.\n\nWhen a client sets the RptEna attribute of a BRCB to true, all new reports \ncontained in the report buffer, starting from the buffer entry following the \nEntryID attribute specified in the BRCB until the most current buffered report, \nare sent. At this time, new reports will be sent as required by normal report \nprocessing. This behavior allows the client to write the last received EntryID \nto the BRCB before enabling the report in an attempt to retrieve all report \nentries that were lost during a lapse in the client association.\n\nWhen insertion of a new report into a report buffer would cause the buffer size \nto be exceeded, the oldest entries in the buffer are discarded until the buffer \nsize has been reduced sufficiently to allow the new report to be added to the \nbuffer. If the reports removed from the buffer have not yet been sent to the \nclient, a buffer overflow indication is set in the next report queued for \ntransmission to indicate that reports have been lost. The buffer overflow \nindication is reported in the BufOvfl field of the report if the buffer overflow \nOptFld has been enabled in the BRCB.\n\nThe contents of a report buffer are deleted when a PurgeBuf is commanded by \na client. As noted in the requirements for the BRCB, the PurgeBuf can only be \ncommanded when the report is disabled. The buffer overflow indication shall \nbe cleared when the client commands a PurgeBuf. Additionally, the buffered \nreports will be purged if any of the BRCB attributes RptID, DatSet, BufTm, \nTrgOps, or IntgPd are modified by the client while the report is disabled.\n\nSqNum 0\n\nTrgOps YES 011011\n\nreserved\n\ndchg TRUE\n\nqchg TRUE\n\ndupda\n\nintegrity TRUE\n\ngi TRUE\n\nIntgPd YES 0\n\nGI YESb,c YESb FALSE\n\nPurgeBuf YESb FALSE\n\nEntryId YES 00 00 00 00 00 00 \n00 00\n\na TrgOps data update (dupd) is not supported.\nb Exhibits a pulse behavior.

The client association occurs when the client enables the RptEna \nattribute of the URCB. Once enabled, each client has independent access to its \ninstance of the URCB and all associated clients receive unbuffered report data. \nThe URCB parameters are shown in Table P.6.\n\nThe URCB Resv attribute is writable, however, the SEL-311C does not \nsupport reservations. Writing any field of the URCB causes the client to \nobtain their own instance of the URCB—in essence, acquiring a reservation.\n\nThe IEC 61850 standard defines the trigger options (TrgOps) of data change, \nquality change, and data update. These TrgOps allow reports to be filtered to \nreport only changes associated with the selected TrgOps. Additionally, each of \nthese TrgOps is only associated with or valid for certain data attributes. The \nvalid TrgOps for any given data attribute is described in the Common Data \nClass (CDC) Descriptions contained within the IEC standard, Part 7-3.\n\nTable P.6 Unbuffered Report Control Block Client Access \n\nRCB Attribute\nUser Changeable \n(Report Disabled)\n\nUser Changeable \n(Report Enabled)\n\nDefault Values\n\nRptId YES URep01–URep07\n\nRptEna YES YES FALSE\n\nResv YES FALSE\n\nDatSet YES URDSet01–\nURDSet07\n\nConfRev 1\n\nOptFlds YES 0111100000\n\nreserved\n\nsequence-number TRUE\n\nreport-time-stamp TRUE\n\nreason-for-\ninclusion\n\nTRUE\n\ndata-set-name TRUE\n\ndata-reference FALSE\n\nconf-revision FALSE\n\nsegmentation\n\nBufTm YES 250\n\nSqNum 0\n\nTrgOps YES 011011\n\nreserved\n\ndchg TRUE\n\nqchg TRUE\n\ndupda\n\na TrgOps data update (dupd) is not supported.\n\nintegrity TRUE\n\ngi TRUE\n\nIntgPd YES 0\n\nGI YESb\n\nb Exhibits a pulse behavior.

The unsolicited report contains only those FCDAs that have \nbeen detected to have changed for a reason corresponding to one of the \nenabled TrgOps.\n\nWhen a client has enabled the RptEna attribute of a BRCB or an URCB, and \nthat same client writes a nonzero value to the GI attribute of the BRCB or \nURCB, a report is sent to that client containing the current data for all FCDA \nwithin the report dataset.\n\nWhen a client has enabled the RptEna attribute and the IntgPd TrgOp of a \nBRCB or an URCB, and the IntgPd attribute of the BRCB or URCB is set to a \nnonzero value, a report is sent to that client containing the current data for all \nFCDAs within the report dataset upon detecting an expiration of the IntgPd.\n\nFCDA updates are serviced every 500 ms. The client can set the report control \nblock (BRCB or URCB) IntgPd to any value greater than 500 ms with a \nresolution of 1 ms. However, the integrity report is only sent when the period \nhas been detected as having expired. The new IntgPd will begin at the time \nthat the current report is serviced.\n\nBufTm timers are part of the report control block (BRCB and URCB). The \npurpose of the BufTm timers is to buffer mutually exclusive data change \nevents over a period of time and send these changes out as one report. Each \nclient that enables an unbuffered report may have a BufTm value independent \nof other clients that enable the same unbuffered report. This does not apply to \nbuffered reports because only one client can enable a buffered report.\n\nReport data are updated every 500 ms. Setting BufTm less than 500 ms does \nnot result in data changes from multiple scans being buffered into a single \nreport. For a BRCB with a nonzero BufTm attribute, a BufTm timer is started \nupon receiving notification of the change of a member of a dataset, and all \nchanges received during BufTm are combined into a single report to be \nbuffered and sent at the expiration of BufTm. If a second internal notification \nof the same member of a dataset has occurred prior to the expiration of \nBufTm, a report is immediately buffered and sent.\n\nReports are formatted as specified in the IEC 61850 standard, Part 7-2, \nTable 24. The report EntryID attribute is incremented each time a report is \nbuilt.\n\nSupplemental \nSoftware\n\nExamine the data structure and values of the supported IEC 61850 LNs with \nan MMS browser such as MMS Object Explorer and AX-S4 MMS from \nSisco, Inc.\n\nThe settings needed to browse an SEL-311C with an MMS browser are shown \nbelow.\n\nOSI-PSEL (Presentation Selector) 00000001\nOSI-SSEL (Session Selector) 0001\nOSI-TSEL (Transport Selector) 0001\n\n\n\nP.12\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nIEC 61850\nGOOSE Processing and Performance\n\nTime Stamps and \nQuality\n\nIn addition to the various data values, the two attributes quality (q) and time \nstamp (t) are available at any time. The timestamp is determined when data or \nquality change is detected and is UTC reported as the Second of Century since \nJanuary 1, 1970, plus fractional seconds.\n\nThe timestamp is applied to all data and quality attributes (Boolean, Bstrings, \nAnalogs, etc.) in the same fashion when a data or quality change is detected.\nFunctionally Constrained Data Attributes (FCDA) mapped to points assigned \nto the SER report have SER-accuracy timestamps for data change events. To \nensure that you will get SER-quality timestamps for changes to certain points, \nyou must include those points in the SER report. All other FCDAs are scanned \nfor data changes on a 1/2-second interval and have 1/2-second timestamp \naccuracy. See SET Command (Change Settings) on page 10.60 for information \non programming the SER report.\n\nThe SEL-311C uses GOOSE quality attributes to indicate the quality of the \ndata in its transmitted GOOSE messages. Under normal conditions, all \nattributes are zero, indicating good quality data. Internal status indicators \nprovide the information necessary for the device to set these attributes. If the \ndevice becomes disabled, as shown via status indications (e.g., an internal \nself-test failure), the SEL-311C will stop transmitting GOOSE messages.\n\nGOOSE Processing and Performance\nSEL devices support GOOSE processing as defined by IEC 61850-7-1:2003(E), \nIEC 61850-7-2:2003(E), and IEC 61850-8-1:2004(E).\nFour times per power system cycle, the relay reads inputs, processes \nprotection algorithms, and controls outputs. Each of these quarter-cycle \nperiods is called a processing interval. GOOSE messages are considered \ninputs and outputs, and are processed with the same priority as contact inputs, \ncontact outputs, and protection algorithms. The relay processes incoming \nGOOSE messages near the beginning of every processing interval just after it \nreads the contact inputs, and processes outgoing GOOSE messages near the \nend of every processing interval after it controls the contact outputs. See \nTable F.4 for more information about processing order in the SEL-311C.\n\nGOOSE \nConstruction Tips\n\n➤ Quality bit strings published from SEL relays are not generally \nuseful in determining the quality of associated data because the \nSEL IEDs suspend publication of GOOSE messages if any \nquality attribute fails. Therefore receipt of the message \nindicates that all quality attributes are normal. Do not include \nquality bit strings in published GOOSE messages unless \nrequired by some other type of IED.\n\n➤ Make GOOSE publications as small as possible. Include in the \nGOOSE publication only the information required by \nsubscribing relays.\n\n➤ Give higher VLAN priority tags to more important GOOSE. \nThis allows the network to preferentially forward those \nGOOSE to the subscribers, and also gives a subscribing \nSEL-311C an indication that the more important GOOSE \nshould be decoded before lower priority GOOSE.\n\n➤ The relay supports no more than 128 unique Boolean elements \nmapped between all GOOSE publications.\n\n\n\nP.13\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nIEC 61850\nGOOSE Processing and Performance\n\nGOOSE Construction Example\nThe dataset shown in Figure P.3 is used in a GOOSE publication from an \nSEL-421. It contains information that is not necessary to a subscribing \nSEL-311C relay. For example, the dataset contains the Mod, Beh, and Health \nfields (ANN.CCOUTGGIO21.Mod.*, ANN.CCOUTGGIO21.Beh.*, and \nANN.CCOUTGGIO21.Health.*) from the CCOUT logical node. In this case, \nthe information in those fields are of no use to a subscribing SEL-311C. Also, \neach of the two CCOUT contained in the dataset are accompanied by their \ncorresponding quality bit strings and time stamps \n(ANN.CCOUTGGIO21.Ind01.q, ANN.CCOUTGGIO21.Ind01.t, ...). If the \nquality field is included in a GOOSE to which the SEL-311C subscribes, then \nthe SEL-311C must spend additional processing time decoding that quality bit \nstring and applying it to the associated data. \n\nFigure P.3 Example of a Poorly Constructed GOOSE Dataset\n\nFigure P.4 shows an example of a GOOSE publication from an SEL-421 with \nbetter construction. This dataset contains only the information required by the \nsubscribing relay(s) to decode the CCOUT status from the publishing \nSEL-421 (.CCOUTGGIO21.Ind01.stVal and CCOUTGGIO21.Ind02.stVal) \nand does not include quality bit strings or time stamps.\n\n\n\nP.14\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nIEC 61850\nGOOSE Processing and Performance\n\nFigure P.4 Example of a Properly Constructed GOOSE Dataset\n\nGOOSE Receive and \nTransmit Capacity\n\nEach processing interval, the relay processes received and transmitted \nGOOSE messages. The relay assigns each received and transmitted message a \npoint value at configuration time (when the relay receives and parses the CID \nfile). The point values for various messages are calculated as described in \nGOOSE Subscription (Receive) Processing on page P.14 and GOOSE \nPublication (Transmit) Processing on page P.19. The number of points that \ncan be received per processing interval is 80 and that can be transmitted per \nprocessing interval is 40.\n\nGOOSE Subscription \n(Receive) Processing\n\nThe relay supports as many as 24 GOOSE subscriptions. GOOSE messages \nwhich arrive at the relay are subjected to the following processing steps when \nport setting EGSE is set to Y.\n\nFilter\nEach message is inspected for proper multicast MAC address and GOOSE \nApp ID. If those parameters match values expected by the relay for one of the \n24 possible GOOSE subscriptions, then the message is passed on to the next \nlevel of processing. Otherwise the message is discarded. Each message on the \nLAN must have a unique combination of multicast MAC address and GOOSE \nApp ID.\n\nBuffer\nThe relay retains the most recent arrival for as many as 24 subscriptions. If a \nsubsequent GOOSE arrives for a subscription that already has a message \nbuffered, then the earlier arrival is discarded.\n\n\n\nP.15\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nIEC 61850\nGOOSE Processing and Performance\n\nDecode\nThe decoding process consists of several stages. Each decoding stage has an \nassociated processing cost, and the relay limits the total cost of all received \nGOOSE decoding to reserve enough time to process protection algorithms, \nprogrammable logic, outputs, outgoing GOOSE messages, etc. If the total \npoint value of the messages in the receive buffers at the beginning of the \nprocessing interval exceeds the capacity given in the GOOSE Receive and \nTransmit Capacity on page P.14, then some messages will be decoded on \nsubsequent processing intervals. The sections below describe how the relay \nscores each message as it is decoded.\n\nHeader Decoding\nEach message contains a header which indicates the status of the message. \nThe relay ignores the remainder of the message if any of four indicators in the \nmessage header are true:\n\n➤ Configuration Mismatch. The configuration number of the \nincoming GOOSE changes.\n\n➤ Needs Commissioning. This Boolean parameter of the \nincoming GOOSE message is true.\n\n➤ Test Mode. This Boolean parameter of the incoming GOOSE \nmessage is true.\n\n➤ State Number. This parameter is the same as the last time the \nmessage was decoded. State Number increments when the \ncontents of the message change, so if the State Number is \nunchanged, there is no reason to decode the rest of the \nmessage.\n\nWhether the header indicates the message should be subjected to further \ndecoding or ignored, decoding the header always costs eight points.\n\nMessage Body Decoding\nThe cost of decoding the message body depends on the structure of the \nmessage. Table P.7 shows the cost of each type of data in the message body, \nand also shows the cost of decoding the message header.\n\nTable P.7 Point Cost of Decoding GOOSE Messages (Sheet 1 of 2)\n\nData Type Description Point Value Comments\n\nMessage header 8 Each message counts for at least eight points, \nregardless of the content of the message.\n\nMessage Quality \nBit\n\nA Boolean value created in the receiving relay \nindicating the status of the received message\n\n0 This bit can always be mapped to local virtual \nbits for zero cost.\n\nBoolean A Boolean value mapped to a virtual bit 1 Boolean values not mapped to local virtual \nbits count as zero points.\n\nQuality Bit String A quality field associated with a data item, \nwhere the data item contains data mapped \nto a virtual bit\n\n1 Quality fields not associated with a data item \ncontaining data that is mapped to a virtual bit \ncount as zero points.\n\nTime Data item time stamp 0 Some data items are accompanied by a time \nstamp. The time stamp is never used or decoded \nby the SEL-311C. It counts as zero points.\n\nBit String (other \nthan Quality)\n\nSeveral bits packed together in the same \ndata item, where at least one of the bits is \nmapped to a virtual bit\n\n1 for the bit \nstring, plus 1 \n\nper bit in the bit \nstring mapped \nto a virtual bit\n\nBit strings are often used for breaker position. \nA bit string that contains no bits mapped to a \nvirtual bit counts as zero points.\n\n\n\nP.16\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nIEC 61850\nGOOSE Processing and Performance\n\nMessage Point Value Calculation Example\nAssume the relay subscribes to a message with 10 Boolean values, five of \nwhich are mapped to local virtual bits. Each of the 10 Boolean values is \naccompanied by a quality indicator. The message also contains one breaker \nposition (a two-bit string) with accompanying quality indicator and time \nstamp. The two bits of breaker position are mapped to two virtual bits in the \nSEL-311C. The message also contains one single precision floating point \nnumber and one double precision floating point number. In addition, the \nmessage quality bit is mapped to a local virtual bit. \n\nThe dataset for such a message is shown in Figure P.5. As described above not \nall items from the dataset are mapped to local resources within the receive \nSEL-311C. Similar to the example GOOSE shown in Figure P.3, the GOOSE \nmessage show in Figure P.5 is poorly constructed and is shown only as an \nexample of a GOOSE message containing several types of data.\n\nFigure P.5 Example Receive GOOSE Dataset\n\nFloating Point Either single or double precision floating \npoint values\n\n0 Floating point values always count as zero \npoints.\n\nOther types of data Any data type other than those shown \nabove\n\nThe relay will correctly process any valid \nGOOSE message to which it subscribes. \nHowever, some data types are costly for the \nrelay to process even if the data are not used \nby the receiving relay. Contact the SEL \nfactory if you must configure the SEL-311C \nto subscribe to GOOSE messages with data \ntypes other than those listed above.\n\nTable P.7 Point Cost of Decoding GOOSE Messages (Sheet 2 of 2)\n\nData Type Description Point Value Comments\n\n\n\nP.17\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nIEC 61850\nGOOSE Processing and Performance\n\nThe score for this message is as follows:\n8 points for the message\n0 points for the message quality bit\n5 points for 5 mapped Booleans\n5 points for 5 quality fields associated with data items that have data \n\nmapped to local virtual bits\n3 points total for the breaker position indication (one for the bit string and \n\none each for the two bits in the string)\n1 point for the quality bit string associated with the breaker position bit \n\nstring\n0 points for the breaker position bit string time stamp\n0 points for the single precision floating point data\n0 points for the double precision floating point number\n22 total points in this message\n\nExamples of GOOSE Subscription (Receive) Processing\nIf the total score for all messages received in a single processing interval is 80 \nor fewer points, then the relay is guaranteed to process and apply all received \ndata during that processing interval. For example, assume the relay subscribes \nto messages as shown in Table P.8.\n\nThe total score for all of the subscribed messages is 80 points. Even if every \nmessage in Table P.8 arrives every processing interval, and even if the header \ninformation from every message indicates that the message must be decoded, the \nrelay is guaranteed to process every message, update the local virtual bits, and use \nthose updated values in programmable logic during that processing interval.\n\nNext, assume that the relay subscribes to messages as shown in Table P.9.\n\nTable P.8 Scores for Subscribed Messages Used in Example \n\nSubscription Number Message Score\n\n1 16\n\n2 20\n\n3 10\n\n4 16\n\n5 18\n\nTOTAL 80\n\nTable P.9 Scores for Subscribed Messages Used in Example (Sheet 1 of 2)\n\nSubscription Number Message Score\n\n1 16\n\n2 28\n\n3 10\n\n4 16\n\n5 16\n\n6 10\n\n7 20\n\n\n\nP.18\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nIEC 61850\nGOOSE Processing and Performance\n\nThe total score for all of the subscribed message is 126 points. Notice that if \nall of the message points are due to message headers and mapped Boolean \nvalues, then these 8 messages represent 62 Boolean values mapped to local \nvirtual bits or breaker control bits. Assume every message arrives during the \nsame processing interval, but messages 1 through 5 are repeats of messages \nprocessed earlier (i.e., those messages do not have changed state numbers). \nThose 5 repeated messages count as 8 points each, or 40 points total. Assume \nmessages 6, 7, and 8 each contain changed data, so the state number has \nincremented since the last time the message was processed. The combined \nscore for messages 6, 7, and 8 is 40 points. So the total score for all messages \nis 80 points. In this case, the relay will process all messages in a single \nprocessing interval.\n\nFinally, assume that the relay subscribes to messages as shown in Table P.10.\n\n8 10\n\nTOTAL 126\n\nTable P.10 Scores for Subscribed Messages Used in Example \n\nSubscription Number Message Score\n\n1 16\n\n2 20\n\n3 10\n\n4 16\n\n5 16\n\n6 10\n\n7 12\n\n8 28\n\n9 16\n\n10 20\n\n11 10\n\n12 16\n\n13 10\n\n14 10\n\n15 12\n\n16 16\n\n17 20\n\n18 10\n\n19 16\n\n20 16\n\n21 10\n\n22 12\n\n23 28\n\n24 16\n\nTotal 366\n\nTable P.9 Scores for Subscribed Messages Used in Example (Sheet 2 of 2)\n\nSubscription Number Message Score\n\n\n\nP.19\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nIEC 61850\nGOOSE Processing and Performance\n\nThe total combined score for all of the subscribed messages is 366 points. As \nlong as messages totaling 80 or fewer points arrive each processing interval, \nthe relay will process all received messages every processing interval. If \nmessages totaling more than 80 points arrive in any processing interval, then \nthe relay will process messages totaling 80 or fewer points and will continue \nprocessing during the next quarter-cycle processing interval.\n\nGOOSE Publication \n(Transmit) Processing\n\nThe relay supports as many as eight GOOSE publications. Each publication \ncan contain data from any logical node in the relay. The relay supports no \nmore than 128 unique Boolean elements mapped between all GOOSE \npublications.\n\nThe relay transmits a message from each publication soon after initialization \n(e.g., after power up). Near the end of each processing interval, the relay \ntransmits one message from as many publications as possible in which the \nstate numbers have incremented. The relay then transmits one message from \nas many publications as possible in which the transmit interval timers have \nexpired. Transmission of GOOSE messages does not occur if the relay is \ndisabled, port setting EGSE is set to NO, or after a permanent self-test failure.\n\nState Number\nThe relay maintains a count of the number of times the contents of a \npublication have changed. The count is called the state number. If the state \nnumber increments, then the relay transmits a message from that publication, \nas discussed below.\n\nTransmit Interval\nIf the data contained in the messages does not change (i.e., if the state number \ndoes not increase), then the relay retransmits the message after a time interval. \nThe first transmission occurs immediately upon the trigger occurring. The \nsecond transmission occurs approximately MinTime later. The third \ntransmission occurs approximately MinTime after the second. The fourth \ntransmission occurs twice MinTime after the third. All subsequent transmissions \noccur at the MaxTime interval. For example, MinTime is 4 ms and MaxTime is \n100 ms; the intervals between transmissions will be 4 ms, 4 ms, 8 ms, and then \n100 ms. If MaxTime is not greater than twice MinTime, the third and all \nsubsequent transmissions will occur at the MaxTime interval. The MinTime and \nMaxTime intervals can be configured for each GOOSE transmit message using \nACSELERATOR Architect software. The time-to-live reported in the first two \nmessages is three times MinTime. The time-to-live in all subsequent messages is \ntwo times MaxTime.\n\nThe total number of message transmissions possible during each processing \ninterval due to either state number changes or transmit interval timeout \ndepends on the structure of the messages to be transmitted. The relay assigns \neach message a point value at configuration time (when the relay receives and \nparses the CID file). Each processing interval the relay processes and \ntransmits messages with total point values as great as the capacity given in the \nGOOSE Receive and Transmit Capacity on page P.14. If messages totaling \nmore than the value given in the GOOSE Receive and Transmit Capacity on \npage P.14 are available to be transmitted either because their transmit intervals \nhave timed out or because their state numbers have incremented, then some of \nthe messages will be transmitted on subsequent processing intervals. \nTable P.11 shows the point value for different parts of the GOOSE message.\n\n\n\nP.20\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nIEC 61850\nGOOSE Processing and Performance\n\nMessage Point Value Calculation Example\nAssume the relay publishes a message with 10 Boolean values. Each of the 10 \nBoolean values is accompanied by a Quality indicator and a time stamp. The \nmessage contains two floating point numbers, each with an associated time \nstamp. \n\nThe dataset for such a message is shown in Figure P.6. Similar to the example \nGOOSE shown in Figure P.3, the GOOSE message show in Figure P.6 is \npoorly constructed and is shown only as an example of a GOOSE message \ncontaining several types of data.\n\nTable P.11 Score For Data Types Contained in Published Messages\n\nData Type Description\nPoint \nValue\n\nComments\n\nMessage 8 Each message counts at least 8 points \nevery time it is transmitted, regardless \nof the content of the message.

Typically, the user first places icons \nrepresenting IEDs in a substation container, then edits the outgoing GOOSE \nmessages or creates new ones for each IED. The user can also select incoming \nGOOSE messages for each IED to receive from any other IEDs in the domain. \n\nSome measured values are reported to IEC 61850 only when the value changes \nbeyond a defined dead-band value. ACSELERATOR Architect allows a dead band to \nbe changed during the CID file configuration. Check and set the dead-band values \nfor your particular application when configuring the CID file for a device. \n\n\n\nP.25\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nIEC 61850\nLogical Node Extensions\n\nACSELERATOR Architect has the capability to read other manufacturers’ ICD \nand CID files, enabling the user to map the data seamlessly into SEL IED \nlogic. See the ACSELERATOR Architect online help for more information.\n\nSEL ICD File Versions ACSELERATOR Architect version R.1.1.69.0 and later supports multiple ICD \nfile versions for each type of IED in a project. Because relays with different \nfirmware versions may require different CID file versions, users can manage \nthe CID files of all IEDs within a single project.\nPlease ensure that you work with the appropriate version of ACSELERATOR \nArchitect relative to your current configuration, existing project files, and \nultimate goals. If you want the best available IEC 61850 functionality for your \nSEL relay, obtain the latest version of ACSELERATOR Architect and select the \nappropriate ICD version(s) for your needs. \nACSELERATOR Architect generates CID files from ICD files so the ICD file \nversion ACSELERATOR Architect uses also determines the CID file version \ngenerated. Details about the different SEL-311C ICD files can be found in \nTable A.2 and Table A.3.\n\nLogical Node Extensions\nThe following Logical Nodes and Data Classes were created in this device as extensions to the IEC 61850 \nstandard, in accordance with IEC 61850 guidelines.\n\nTable P.15 New Logical Node Extensions\n\nLogical Node IEC 61850 Description or Comments\n\nDemand Metering MDST Demand and peak demand values for current and energy.\n\nCircuit Breaker Supervision SCBR Circuit breaker supervision abrasion and operation values.\n\nTable P.16 Demand Metering Logical Node Class Definition (Sheet 1 of 2)\n\nIEC 61850 Logical Node Class: MDST\n\nAttribute \nName\n\nAttribute \nType\n\nData \nSource\n\nExplanation Ta M/O/C/Eb\n\nLNName The name shall be composed of the class name, LN-Prefix and \nLN-Instance-ID according to IEC 61850-7-2.\n\nData\n\nCommon Logical Node Information\n\nLN shall inherit all mandatory data from Common Logical Node \nClass\n\nM\n\nMeasured Values\n\nDmdA.nseq MV 3I2DEM Demand, negative-sequence current O\n\nPkDmdA.nseq MV 3I2PK Peak demand, negative-sequence current O\n\nDmdA.phsA MV IADEM Demand, phase A current O\n\nPkDmdA.phsA MV IAPK Peak demand, phase A current O\n\nDmdA.phsB MV IBDEM Demand, phase B current O\n\nPkDmdA.phsB MV IBPK Peak demand, phase B current O\n\nDmdA.phsC MV ICDEM Demand, phase C current O\n\nPkDmdA.phsC MV ICPK Peak demand, phase C current O\n\n\n\nP.26\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nIEC 61850\nLogical Node Extensions\n\nDmdA.res MV IGDEM Demand, residual current O\n\nPkDmdA.res MV IGPK Peak demand, residual current O\n\nDmdA.neut MV INDEM Demand, neutral current O\n\nPkDmdA.neut MV INPK Peak demand, neutral current O\n\nSupVArh MV MVRH3I Energy, reactive (MVARh), supply direction toward busbar O\nDmdVArh MV MVRH3O Energy, reactive (MVARh), supply direction away from busbar O\nSupWh MV MWH3I Energy, real (MWh), supply direction toward busbar O\nDmdWh MV MWH3O Energy, real (MWh), supply direction away from busbar O\na Transient data objects—the status of data objects with this designation is momentary and must be logged or reported to provide evidence \n\nof their momentary state.\nb M: Mandatory;

features to help meet cybersecurity \ndesign requirements.\n\nAccess Control\nThe SEL-311C has a number of mechanisms for managing electronic access. \nThese include ways to limit access, provide user authentication, and monitor \nelectronic and physical access.\n\nPhysical Port \nControls\n\nEach physical serial port and the Ethernet port can be individually disabled \nusing the EPORT setting. By default, all of the ports are enabled. It is good \nsecurity practice to disable unused ports.\n\nIP Ports When using Ethernet, there are a number of IP ports available within the \nSEL-311C. Many of these IP port numbers are configurable. All IP ports can \nbe disabled and are disabled by default. Table Q.1 describes each of these.\n\nSee Port 5 Settings (for Ethernet Port 5, or 5A and 5B) (Serial Port SET P 5 \nCommand) on page SET.48 for more information on these settings.\n\nTable Q.1 IP Port Numbers\n\nIP Port \nDefault\n\nPort \nSelection \nSetting\n\nNetwork \nProtocol\n\nDefault \nPort \nState\n\nPort \nEnable \nSetting\n\nPurpose\n\n21 – TCP Disabled EFTPSERV FTP protocol access \nfor file transfer of \nsettings and reports\n\n23 TPORT TCP Disabled ETELNET Telnet access for gen-\neral engineering \nterminal access\n\n80 HTTPPORT TCP Disabled EHTTP Web server access to \nread various relay \ninformation\n\n102 – TCP Disabled E61850 IEC 61850 MMS for \nSCADA functionality\n\n123 SNTPPORT UDP Disabled ESNTP SNTP time \nsynchronization\n\n4712/ \n4713\n\nPMOTCP1/ \nPMOUDP1\n\nTCP/UDP Disabled PMOTS1 Synchrophasor data \noutput, Session 1\n\n4722/ \n4713\n\nPMOTCP2/ \nPMOUDP2\n\nTCP/UDP Disabled PMOTS2 Synchrophasor data \noutput, Session 2\n\n20000 DNPNUM TCP/UDP Disabled EDNP DNP for SCADA \nfunctionality\n\n\n\nQ.2\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nCybersecurity Features\nAccess Control\n\nAuthentication and \nAuthorization\n\nThe SEL-311C supports four levels of access, as described in the Port Access \nLevels on page 10.18. Refer to this section to learn how each level is accessed \nand how to change passwords. It is good security practice to change the default \npasswords of each access level and to use a unique password for each level.\n\nThe MAXACC setting limits the level of access for each port. This permits \nyou to operate under the principle of “least privilege,” restricting ports to the \nlevels necessary for the functions performed on those ports.\n\nThe SEL-311C supports strong passwords with as many as 12 characters, \nusing any printable character, allowing users to select complex passwords if \nthey so choose. SEL recommends that passwords have a minimum of 8 \ncharacters and include at least one of each of the following: lowercase letter, \nuppercase letter, number, and special character.\n\nEthernet protocols Telnet, FTP, and HTTP require the proper passwords to \ngain access to level-protected functions. Ethernet protocol MMS requires a \npassword to gain access if MMS Authentication is enabled via the CID file. \nSee Section 10: Communications for more information on access restrictions \nfor the Ethernet protocols.\n\nMonitoring and \nLogging\n\nThe SEL-311C provides Relay Word bits that are useful for monitoring relay \naccess:\n\n➤ BADPASS—Pulses for approximately one second if a user \nenters three successive incorrect passwords in an SEL ASCII \nterminal session or web session.\n\n➤ ACCESS—Asserted while any user is logged into Access \nLevel B or higher.\n\n➤ ACCESSP—Pulses for approximately one second whenever a \nuser gains access to an access level of B or higher.\n\n➤ PASNVAL—Pulses for approximately one second when an \nincorrect password is entered when attempting to Access Level \nB or higher, or when an incorrect password is entered when \nattempting to change passwords.\n\n➤ LINK5, LINK5A, LINK5B—Asserted while the link is active \non the Ethernet port(s). Loss of link can be an indication that \nan Ethernet cable has been disconnected.\n\n➤ LNKFAIL—Asserted if link is lost on the active IP port \n(Ports 5, 5A, or 5B).\n\nThese bits can be mapped for SCADA monitoring via DNP3, IEC 61850, \nModbus, or SEL Fast Message. They also may be added to the SER for later \nanalysis or assigned to output contacts for alarm purposes.\n\nThe SEL-311C SER is a useful tool for capturing a variety of relay events. In \naddition to capturing state changes of user selected Relay Word bits, it captures \nall power-ups, settings changes, and group switches. See Sequential Events \nRecorder (SER) Report on page 12.28 for more information about SER.\n\nPhysical Access \nSecurity\n\nPhysical security of cybersecurity assets is a common concern. SEL-311C \nrelays can be installed within a control house that provides physical security. \nOther times, relays are installed in breakers or enclosures within the \nswitchyard. The SEL-311C provides tools to help manage physical security, \nespecially when the unit is installed in the switch yard.\n\n\n\nQ.3\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nCybersecurity Features\nConfiguration Management\n\nYou can monitor physical ingress by wiring a door sensor to one of the \nSEL-311C contact inputs. This input can then be mapped for SCADA \nmonitoring or added to the SER log so that you can monitor when physical \naccess to the relay occurs.\n\nIt is also possible to wire an electronic latch to an SEL-311C contact output. \nYou could then map this output for SCADA control. \n\nConfiguration Management\nMany users are concerned about managing the configuration of their relays. \nThe SEL-311C provides mechanisms to help users manage relay \nconfiguration.\n\nAll settings changes are logged to the SER log. Analysis of this log indicates \nif any unauthorized settings changes occurred.\n\nThe following Relay Word bits also indicate changes in relay configuration:\n\n➤ SETCHG—Pulses for approximately one second when settings \nare changed or saved\n\n➤ CHGPASS—Pulses for approximately one second when a \npassword changes\n\n➤ GRPSW—Pulses for approximately one second when the relay \nswitches settings groups\n\nThe SEL-311C also stores a hash code for each settings class in the CFG.TXT \nfile. After configuring the device, read the CFG.TXT file and store it for future \nreference. Periodically read this file from the relay and compare it to the \nstored reference. If any of the hash codes have changed, then that settings \nclass has been modified.\n\nFirmware Hash Verification\nThis device supports digitally signed firmware upgrades. SEL uses the SHA-1 \nsecure hash algorithm to compress and digitally sign firmware upgrade files. \nThe signature ensures that the file has been provided by SEL and that its \ncontents have not been altered.   When the file is uploaded to the relay, the \nsignature is verified using a public key stored on the relay. If the relay cannot \nverify the signature, it rejects the file. See Appendix B: \nFirmware Upgrade Instructions for SEL-311C Relays With Ethernet for more \ninformation on firmware upgrades.\n\nMalware Protection\nThe SEL-311C has inherent and continuous monitoring for Malware. For a \nfull description of this, see\nhttp://www.selinc.com/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=6155.\n\n\n\nQ.4\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nCybersecurity Features\nSecurity Vulnerabilities\n\nSecurity Vulnerabilities\nIf SEL finds a security vulnerability with the SEL-311C, it will be disclosed \nusing our standard security notification process. For a full description of this \nprocess, see http://www2.selinc.com/security_notifications/security.php.\n\nSettings Erasure\nIt is often desirable to erase the settings from the relay when it is removed \nfrom service. You can completely erase all the configuration settings from the \nSEL-311C using this procedure:\n\nStep 1. Go to Access Level C. See ACC, BAC, 2AC, and CAL \nCommands (Go to Access Level 1, B, 2, or C) on page 10.34\n\nStep 2. Execute the R_S command.\nStep 3. Allow the relay to restart.\n\nOnce this procedure is complete, all internal instances of user settings and \npasswords will be erased. Do not do this when sending in the relay for service \nat the factory. SEL needs to see how the relay was configured in order to \nproperly diagnose many problems.\n\nNOTE: Do not erase settings when \nsending the relay for service at the \nfactory. SEL needs to be able to see \nhow the relay was configured to \nproperly diagnose any problems.\n\n\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nAppendix R\nR.Instruction Manual\n\nFault Location and Supplemental Fault \nLocation and Impedance Data\n\nFault Location\nThe SEL-311C relay calculates and reports a line-distance-to-fault location \nusing event report voltage and current data samples to determine the \nimpedance to the fault. See Standard 15/30/60/180-Cycle Event Reports on \npage 12.2 for additional information on event recording, event summaries, and \nfault location. \n\nThe relay scales the calculated impedance against the known line impedance \nand line length values entered in the Line Parameter Settings (line length \nsetting, LL, and line impedance settings, Z1MAG, Z1ANG, Z0MAG, and \nZ0ANG) to determine the distance to the fault.\nThe fault location calculated from single-ended fault data using an \nimpedance-based method is a best estimate. On lines with two or more active \nsources the following factors can affect fault location calculations:\n\n➤ Fault contribution from remote sources\n\n➤ Nonhomogeneous source impedances\n\n➤ Load flow\n\n➤ Fault resistance\n\nThe fault location calculation performed by the SEL-311C is designed to \nminimize the influence of these power system complexities. For further \ninformation on fault location calculations, refer to SEL technical papers listed \nat the end of this section.\n\nThe fault location appears in a variety of relay reports, including the \nfollowing:\n\n➤ Formatted and compressed event reports generated from EVE \nand CEV commands, respectively.\n\n➤ Formatted and compressed long summary event reports \ngenerated from SUM and CSU commands, respectively,\n\n➤ The Event Summaries/History report generated from the HIS \ncommand.\n\n➤ In the *.HDR file provided with COMTRADE event reporting\n\nThe fault location is also available in the front-panel HMI events data and as a \ndata point for communication through various protocols to master and peer \ndevices.\n\n\n\nR.2\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nFault Location and Supplemental Fault Location and Impedance Data\nSupplemental Fault Location Data\n\nFault Location \nRequirements\n\nSelected criteria must be met to provide a valid fault location (e.g., the fault \nlocation function is enabled by setting EFLOC = Y, sufficient fault data are \navailable, appropriate protection elements are asserted, and a valid fault-type \nis determined). If these criteria are not met, the distance-to-fault location \nappears as all dollar signs ($$$$$$$) in the relay reports. For more \ninformation on fault location requirements, see Fault Location on page 12.7.\n\nSupplemental Fault Location Data\nThe SEL-311C also calculates the following supplemental fault location and \nfault impedance data that appear in selected reports:\n\n➤ Impedance to the fault location (magnitude and angle) in \nsecondary ohms and degrees, respectively.\n\n➤ Distance to the fault in per-unit of line length.\n\nThe front-panel HMI events data and long summary event reports (formatted \nand compressed) include this supplemental fault location and impedance data. \nThe impedance to the fault location is provided for comparison with the \nrespective positive-sequence zone distance element reach settings. The \ndistance to the fault in per-unit of line length is provided for comparison with \nthe desired per-unit reach of each zone with respect to the overall line length. \nThe basic fault location and supplemental fault impedance data are shown \ngraphically on an R-X impedance plane in Figure R.1 below:\n\nFigure R.1 Graphical Representation of SEL-311C Fault Location Data\n\nX\n\nR\n\nRelay located at origin of \nimpedance plane\n\nSEL-311C Fault Location Data\nDistance to fault location\n\nin units of line length\n---------------------------\n\nDistance to fault location\nin per-unit of line length\n\n---------------------------\nImpedance to fault location\n\nLine Impedance:\nZ1L = Z1MAG ∠ Z1ANG \n\n\n\nR.3\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nFault Location and Supplemental Fault Location and Impedance Data\nFault Resistance\n\nFault Resistance\n\nFault resistance includes the resistance of the arc created during the fault, and \nmay also include other fault path current limiters (e.g., tower footing \nresistance for faults involving ground, tree limbs) that are either not known or \nnot typically included in the fault study impedance model. The effect of fault \nresistance is to increase the apparent fault impedance, thereby decreasing the \nfault current from its calculated maximum available fault current for a fault at \nthat location on the system. \n\nThe SEL-311C reports the calculated fault resistance as FAULT R in the \nfront-panel HMI events data, as Fault Resistance in the formatted Long \nSummary Event Report (SUM) and as FLT_R in the compressed Long Event \nSummary Report (CSU) and COMTRADE *.HDR files. \n\nPhase-to-Ground \nFaults\n\nThe fault resistance, Rfault, for a phase-to-ground fault is represented \nschematically in Figure R.2(a), below. Figure R.2(b) shows the fault \nresistance represented vectorially on a positive-sequence R-X impedance \nplane. The fault resistance vector is shown as Rfault/(1 + k0L), adjusted by the \nzero-sequence compensation factor, (1 + k0L), for display in the \npositive-sequence domain. The compensation factor is actually IA/IR + k0L \nfor a phase A-to-ground fault. In a radial circuit, IA = IR, resulting in 1 + k0L. \nHowever, in a network with more than one source, the phase current and \nresidual ground current may be, and are most likely, different because of fault \ncontribution from remote sources.\n\nFigure R.2 Schematic (a) and Vectoral (b) Representation of Fault Resistance, Rfault, for a Phase-to-Ground Fault\n\nX\n\nR\n\nRfault/(1 + k0L)\n\nApparent Impedance to Fault\nZapp = VA–N/(IA + k0L * IR)\n\nFault Location \nImpedance = m * Z1L\n\nZ1L = Z1MAG ∠ Z1ANG \n\nZ1s m • Z1L\n\nZ1s\n\nEs\n\n(a) (b)\n\nRfault\n\nm • Z1L\n\nVC–N\n\nVB–N\n\nVA–N\n\nI\nR\n\nI\nA\n\nI\nB\n\nI\nC\n\nm • k0L • Z1L\n\nRelay Location\n\nZ1s m • Z1L\n\nWhere:\nZ1s =\n\nZ1L =\n\nm =\n\nPositive-sequence\n source impedance\nPositive-sequence\n line impedance\nDistance to fault in\n per-unit of line length\n\nZero-sequence\n compensation value:\n   k0L = (Z0L — Z1L)/3Z1L\n\nValues measured\n by relay:\n\n\n\nR.4\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nFault Location and Supplemental Fault Location and Impedance Data\nFault Resistance\n\nPhase-to-Phase \nFaults\n\nFigure R.3(a) shows the schematic representation of the fault resistance for a \nphase-to-phase fault. And Figure R.3(b) shows the phase-to-phase fault \nresistance represented vectorially on a positive-sequence R-X impedance \nplane, where Rfault/2 adjusts the fault resistance to the fault location impedance, \nm • Z1L, that is one-half the fault loop impedance without fault resistance.\n\nFigure R.3 Schematic (a) and Vectoral (b) Representation of Fault Resistance, Rfault, for a Phase-to-Phase Fault\n\nCalculation Method The SEL-311C calculates the resistance of the fault by taking the real part of \nthe difference between the fault location impedance and the apparent fault \nimpedance, Zapp, as shown graphically in Figure R.2(b) and Figure R.3(b).\nThe calculated fault resistance determined through this technique is valid for a \nradial line application. As shown in Figure R.4, the voltage, VS, measured by \nthe relay at Bus S, is the sum of the line voltage drop to the fault, V', and the \nvoltage drop, V\", across the fault resistance, RF. The voltage V\" across the \nfault resistance is a function of the fault current times the fault resistance. On a \nradial system, where the fault current through the fault resistance is the same \nas the current, IS, measured by the relay at Terminal S, the fault resistance \ncalculated from the Terminal S single-ended fault data is relatively accurate. \n\nOn a multiterminal line, the current, IS, measured by the relay at Bus S is a \nfraction of the total fault current (IF = IS + IR). The fault resistance, RFS, \ncalculated from the single-ended fault data is therefore greater than the actual \nfault resistance by a factor of IF/IS.\n\nFigure R.4 Currents and Voltages in a Two-Terminal Line Fault With Fault \nResistance, RF\n\nZ1s m • Z1L\n\nZ1s\n\nEs\n\n(a) (b)\n\nRfault\n\nm • Z1L\n\nVC–N\n\nVB–N\n\nVA–N\n\nI\nA\n\nI\nB\n\nI\nC\n\nm • k0L • Z1L\n\nDistance Relay Location\n\nZ1s m • Z1L\n\nWhere:\nZ1s =\n\nZ1L =\n\nm =\n\nPositive-sequence\n source impedance\nPositive-sequence\n line impedance\nDistance to fault in\n per-unit of line length\n\nZero-sequence\n compensation value:\n   k0L = (Z0L — Z1L)/3Z1L\n\nValues measured\n by relay:\n\nX\n\nR\n\nApparent Impedance to Fault\nZapp = VB–C/IB–C\n\nFault Location\nImpedance = m * Z1L\n\nZ1L = Z1MAG ∠ Z1ANG \n\nRfault/2\n\nE\nS\n∠δ IS IR\n\nV’’IF\n\nV\nR\n\nV\nS\n\nE\nR\n∠0\n\nBUS S BUS R\n\nZ\nS\n\nm • Z\nL\n\n(1—m) • Z\nL\n\nZ\nR\n\nR\nFS\n\nV’\n\n\n\nR.5\n\nDate Code 20140730 Instruction Manual SEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System\n\nFault Location and Supplemental Fault Location and Impedance Data\nFault Resistance\n\nFigure R.5 shows a representation of two parallel fault resistance values, each \ncalculated independently from single-ended fault data at Bus S and Bus R. \nRFS is the fault resistance value calculated from the Bus S terminal using fault \nvoltage VS and fault current IS. RFR is the fault resistance value calculated \nfrom the Bus R terminal using fault voltage VR and fault current IR.\n\nFigure R.5 Currents and Voltages in a Two-Terminal Line Fault With Parallel \nFault Resistance Values, RFS and RFR\n\nThere is value in knowing the amplified fault resistance calculated at each \nterminal because it represents the fault resistance seen by the relay at each \nterminal. Therefore, the relay resistive reach needs to exceed this value to \nreliably detect the fault. \n\nA two-ended fault location analysis is required to obtain a more accurate \nmeasure of actual fault resistance. The two-ended fault location analysis has \nthe advantage of knowing the total fault current, IF, which can then be used to \naccurately calculate the fault resistance. Likewise, knowing the total fault \ncurrent also makes the two-ended fault location analysis more accurate.\n\nAs an alternative, the fault resistance, RF, can be calculated with relatively \ngood accuracy from the two fault resistances, RFS and RFR that are available \nindividually from SEL-311C relay event report data at each line terminal so \nlong as the event reports were triggered at the same time. The calculation \nsimply uses the classic paralleling equation:\n\nEquation R.1\n\nThis technique works for both phase-to-ground and phase-to-phase faults, and \ncan be expanded to include more than two sources by simply adding (1/RN) \nterms inside the [ ] brackets. When sequential tripping occurs on \nmulti-terminal systems, the fault resistance from the relay that tripped last \nshould be used since the system was effectively radial when that relay \noperated.\n\nReported Fault \nResistance\n\nThe reported fault resistance quantity depends on the fault type information.\n\n➤ The reported fault resistance value for a three-phase fault will \nbe the phase-to-phase fault resistance that is the minimum of \nthe three possible phase-to-phase quantities.\n\n➤ The reported fault resistance value for a \nphase-to-phase-to-ground fault will be the phase-to-phase fault \nresistance. \n\nE\nS\n∠δ IS IR\n\nV’’IS IR\n\nV\nR\n\nV\nS\n\nE\nR\n∠0\n\nBUS S BUS R\n\nZ\nS\n\nm • Z\nL\n\n(1—m) • Z\nL\n\nZ\nR\n\nR\nFS\n\nR\nFR\n\nRF\n1\n\nRFS\n---------  \n\n1\nRFR\n----------  +\n\n1–\n=\n\n\n\nR.6\n\nSEL-311C-2, -3 Transmission Protection System Instruction Manual Date Code 20140730\n\nFault Location and Supplemental Fault Location and Impedance Data\nSEL Technical Papers for Further Reading\n\n➤ The reported fault resistance value for a phase-to-phase fault \nwill be the phase-to-phase fault resistance.\n\n➤ The reported fault resistance value for a phase-to-ground fault \nwill be the phase-to-ground fault resistance.\n\nSEL Technical Papers for Further Reading\nE.O.
